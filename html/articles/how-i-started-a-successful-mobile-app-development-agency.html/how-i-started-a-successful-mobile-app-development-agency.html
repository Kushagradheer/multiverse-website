                                            <p>Hello! My name is <a href="https://www.praharshbhatt.com/">Praharsh
                                                    Bhatt</a> and I’m the founder of
                                                <a href="https://multiverseapp.com/">Multiverse Software India</a>.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Multiverse is a mobile application development agency that specializes in
                                                providing rapid and affordable software development. In particular, we
                                                develop mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms alongside the web
                                                backend that helps make them run smoothly and scale efficiently. We are
                                                based out of India however many of our clients are located throughout
                                                the United States.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Multiverse works with a wide variety of clients ranging from startups
                                                ($10k-$50k budgets) to larger enterprise organizations ($100k+ budgets).
                                                Over the past year and a half, Multiverse has nearly tripled the number
                                                of clients and inbound leads we have received, I’ll discuss how we did
                                                that a little later!
                                            </p>


                                            <h2>What's my backstory and how did I come up with the idea?</h2>

                                            <p>While I was in middle school, I started getting interested in software
                                                and coding. I started developing desktop applications by self-learning
                                                and fell in love with it. Come my senior year, I decided to follow this
                                                interest and study Computer Science at Gandhinagar Institute of
                                                Technology. This is where all the magic began to happen.
                                                Around this time, I had long been dreaming of creating an
                                                <a href="../../apps/app-extreme.html">Iron Man
                                                    Movie-inspired JARVIS like assistant</a>. At this time, Apple’s Siri
                                                had
                                                just
                                                launched, but there was no sign of Google Assistant, not yet. I had in
                                                fact
                                                developed a prototype of a similar software of Desktop when I was in
                                                middle
                                                school.
                                                <img src="images/extreme_voice_assistant_for_desktop.webp"
                                                    style="width:100%; margin: 10.00px"
                                                    alt="Multiverse Extreme Voice Assistant for Desktop" />
                                            </p>



                                            <p>This was a very terrible-looking thing, glued with gum and duct tape. But
                                                it worked! I could give commands like opening apps, fetching the
                                                weather, copying files, and even crawling through sites like Facebook to
                                                speak out new notifications!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>This was all I needed to have a proof of concept on any platform, that
                                                works. Now I wanted to bring this to the mobile world starting with
                                                Android.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>This is exactly what I did in a year. I released the <a
                                                    href="../../apps/app-extreme.html">Extreme Assistant
                                                    on Android</a>, and it took the market by storm! Right now, Extreme
                                                sits on
                                                around 10 Million active users from the Google play store, the Samsung
                                                Galaxy store, the Huawei App Gallery, and the Amazon app store combined
                                                without any marketing. Extreme was also nominated for GMASA Awards 2018,
                                                was
                                                in the top charts in Google’s made for Billions, and was one of the

                                            <h2>My process of launching the business</h2>

                                            <p>When it came time to officially launch the business, having an online
                                                presence was a priority. I personally was not much of a web developer or
                                                graphic designer, so it made making a website a bit difficult.
                                            </p>


                                            <h2>Growing our online presence </h2>
                                            <p>Okay, so having a website was cool and everything, but what’s the point
                                                of having one if nobody goes to it?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>This is where SEO began to play a big role. What Multiverse Software
                                                needed was to show up on Google when people would search for things like
                                                “Flutter app developer”.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Through creating blog posts and some trial and error, we were able to
                                                start getting ranked high on Google. Within days, we began to get phone
                                                calls and emails inquiring about our services!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>When it comes to creating a good SEO strategy, you must first figure out
                                                what you want to get out of SEO. Obviously, you want to show up in
                                                search engine results, but you have to figure out what your site should
                                                be showing up under. For example, if I am a baker targeting people in
                                                Denver, Colorado, I am going to want to write blog posts or specific
                                                websites tailored to that location and any other specific keywords such
                                                as “baking, cookies, brownies, custom cakes, bakeries, etc). This will
                                                allow your site to come up when someone searches something like “custom
                                                cake bakery in Denver”. Once this is complete, you should make sure to
                                                sign up with Google’s Webmaster Tools and have Google crawl your
                                                website.
                                            </p>

                                                is constant communication and transparency of what is going on. Through

                                                and our clients through Slack.com, allows the client to get a full and

                                            <p>Since a lot of our clients are startups, they normally have tight
                                                budgets. With that being said, it is critical that we help provide our
                                                clients with the most affordable costs around. Through the numerous apps
                                                and platforms we have worked on, we have been able to standardize the
                                                general development process and in turn saving time and money.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>One of the biggest things we have standardized has been our project
                                                setup. By working with numerous types of clients, we were able to find
                                                what libraries, frameworks, and project structures all of them had in
                                                common. From this, we have developed our own frameworks that will
                                                automatically be in any project once it is created. With the process and

                                            <h2>How are you doing today and what does the future look like?</h2>
                                            <p>Today, Multiverse Software is doing better than ever. We are profitable
                                                and learning every day how to become more efficient and save money for
                                                both the customer and Multiverse Software. One thing we have learned is
                                                that referrals are worth so much more than anything else. People are 20x
                                                more likely to go with a developer that was referred to them, than a
                                                developer that found from a google search. This is why it is critical to
                                                provide a successful and pleasant experience.</p>
                                            <p>Through SEO and social media marketing, we have increased the number of
                                                visitors to our site tenfold. Every month we have over 10,000 visitors
                                                to our site. We have tried using Google and Facebook ads, but
                                                unfortunately, they didn’t provide a very good conversion for a service
                                                like ours. </p>
                                            <p>We currently have a team of seven individuals working with Multiverse
                                                Software both full time and part time, ranging from designers, account
                                                managers, and developers (android, iOS, and Web). It is our goal to
                                                double the number of clients we currently have per month and cut in half
                                                the amount of development time for each client by the end of the year.

                                            <h2>Through starting the business, what have I learned particularly helpful
                                                or advantageous?</h2>
                                            <p>One thing I have learned in particular is to be cautious with hiring. I
                                                once heard that you should hire slowly and fire quickly.</p>
                                            <p>Unfortunately, I heard this after the fact and did the complete opposite.
                                                There was a brief time in 2018 when we had a huge influx of clients and
                                                we didn’t have enough developers to take on the new projects. The last
                                                thing I wanted to do was turn away these potential clients, so I decided
                                                to hire developers. </p>


                                            <p>I had hired about 4 developers in a span of a month based on the
                                                experience that they had told me they had. As they began working on
                                                projects, I had realized the quality of their work was not very good and
                                                I had to keep jumping in to correct issues that they did not take care
                                                of. I decided not to fire them right away because it may be beneficial
                                                to just teach them, and hopefully they would become better.</p>
                                            <p>Time went on and the same problems with the quality of the code being
                                                produced was not satisfactory and I ended up spending more time fixing
                                                code, than just doing it myself. At this point in time, a few months had
                                                past and I had spent over $100k on these developers which ended up being
                                                a complete loss. I decided to let these developers go and limit the
                                                number of clients we worked with at a time.</p>
                                            <p>Make sure you really vet people out before hiring them. Also, don’t be
                                                afraid to say no if you can’t handle the work. It is often more
                                                beneficial to limit the amount of work you have on your hands so you can
                                                ensure quality. Clients will value this a lot more than providing a poor
                                                product. In our case, we ended up just having a waitlist, which worked
                                                out even better because it allowed our clients to get the funds and
                                                resources needed to really get going with their endeavor.</p>
