                                            <h1>Tempo Meditation and Breathing App Case study</h1>

                                            In this case study, I’m going to talk about my process of how I designed
                                            Tempo’s website from scratch. I will share my process, design decisions, and
                                            approach towards the design.<br /><br />

                                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                                            <p>The inception of this project began a month ago when our client, who is
                                                also a practising pharmacist in the United Kingdom,
                                                reached out to us with his idea of mindfulness and breathing
                                                application, we were more than excited to lay our hands in the process.
                                                His main purpose was to allow users to breathe effectively because he
                                                believes and has been proven that the way we breathe affects our mental
                                                and physical health.

                                                He not only came up with the idea but he also had some of the detailed
                                                sketches of the concept and how he wanted the design of the application
                                                to be.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>According to the stats, alone in the US, around 15.27 million people
                                                suffer from depression every year and more than 300 million people
                                                worldwide as per a renowned report. While more than twice of those
                                                numbers showed up for anxiety.
                                            </p>


                                            <p>The constant technological distraction and changing lifestyles have
                                                destroyed our ability to focus on something for a longer period of time.
                                                Now, more than ever before, is high-time to do something about our
                                                mental health and physical wellness and that’s where our application
                                                with its guided breathing technique - Tempo fits in.
                                            </p>


                                            <strong>Basics</strong>
                                            Before we start, let’s see what it took:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Time : 15-20 days</li>
                                                <li>Tools : Adobe XD, Figma, Canva</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            </br>


                                            <strong>The Problem and the Motivation:</strong>


                                            <p>Breathing is such an essential part of our lives that it's possible that
                                                many of us overlook it. We can have conscious control of it when we are
                                                talking or singing. It is also, thankfully, automatically controlled
                                                such as when we are sleeping or when we are concentrating on other
                                                things.
                                            </p>


                                            <p>While it is obviously essential to breathe regularly, the way you breathe
                                                is also important and can have a direct effect on your mental and
                                                physical state. Good breathing involves inflating the lungs as fully as
                                                is possible and in a controlled, rhythmical way. Breathing is like many
                                                actions we perform, there's a good way to breathe but there are also
                                                less efficient ways.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The main goal for us, at Multiverse Software, was to:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <ol>Introduce users to a new way of Breathing</ol>
                                                <ol>Multiple Breathing patterns to choose from</ol>
                                                <ol>Ability to upload your own breathing patterns</ol>
                                                <ol>Form a strong community</ol>
                                                <ol>Helping Vibrations, voice-over and background music</ol>
                                            </ul>
                                            </br>



                                            <h2>Goal</h2>
                                            Our main goal was to create an app with the following traits:
                                            <ul>
                                                <ol>Allows the user to use personalized curated breathing patterns.</ol>
                                                <ol>Allows the user to create and use customized breathing patterns.

                                            <p>When starting on a project, I usually use the Design Process to make my
                                                designs be as consistent as possible. The UX design process can be
                                                divided into four key phases: User Research, Define & Analysis, Strategy
                                                and Design.

                                            <p>We did not just want to provide guided breathing techniques to our users
                                                but also let them know that we care as Tempo provides the user with a
                                                platform to form a breathing community. This breathing application has
                                                numerous guided breathing techniques which are very well thought and
                                                curated according to different needs of the user. The “Build Your
                                                Community” part allows the users to upload their customized breathing
                                                patterns which they themselves or other people might want to use.

                                                patterns, the breaths are very generalized, it is assumed that everyone

                                                If you have read the book Blue Ocean Strategy, you must be familiar with
                                                the
                                                concept of red and blue oceans. Renée Mauborgne explains that if you are
                                                competing with mammoth companies, the best strategy is to create a whole
                                                new
                                                market for your product, which instead of competing with the former
                                                products, complements them.

                                            <p>Our goal was not to compete with apps like Oak or Calm, rather make a

                                                new product that delivers a great user experience without getting
                                                bombarded
                                                with hundreds of ads, or continuously bottlenecked by your free plan.

                                            <p>We did kinds of research about other apps and we found that people do not
                                                really enjoy using the apps because the billing is overpriced and
                                                without notification just charged into their CC.

                                                In addition, the user does not feel comfortable with the meditation
                                                options provided and even makes the user more stressed.

                                                And there are users who feel that this application lacks the auto sleep
                                                feature so that the user has to turn it off even though he is very

                                            <p>From several reviews from other apps, we got some inspiration on what we
                                                should implement and in our apps such us every feature is free,

                                            <h3>“Minimal yet energetic Interface”</h3>

                                            <p>Our goal was to design a product that was not really Material and neither
                                                Cupertino but delivered a very familiar feel, so users did not have to
                                                search for any option, everything was right there, without overwhelming
                                                the users.

                                                Every website should have a goal and a purpose. Sites without clear
                                                goals are often unfocused and hard to navigate. So, we decided to make a
                                                sitemap so we could better understand the user’s paths and the
                                                platform’s structure.

                                                There are many different ways for users to interact with products. A
                                                user flow is a visual representation, either written out or made
                                                digitally, of the many avenues that can be taken when using an app or
                                                website (BROWNE, 2019) . The flow cart begins with the user opening
                                                Tempo’s app like onboarding screen or homepage and ends with the final
                                                action or outcome, like listening to the audio or signing up for an
                                                account.

                                            <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Paper prototyping apps and websites is a method some design teams use to
                                                begin conceptualizing a new product or feature (Joseph Downs, 2021).
                                                Also it also helps to demonstrate the user flow and functionality that
                                                your future design will have in the very early stages of ideation. These
                                                played the part of low-fi wireframes.

                                                A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the
                                                elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a
                                                product. (Hacq, 2018)

                                                Design systems makes design consistent as a tool for designer and also
                                                developer to make patterns, guidelines and unique for every application.

                                            <h2>UI Design</h2>
                                            <p>There are several considerations when I designed Tempo’s App

                                                It is a sleep application so it needs to be simple
                                                It will probably be used a lot in the evening so a darker UI is
                                                essential

                                                Because this is for breathing apps, I need to cut unnecessarily
                                                complicated or long flow. The goal should be to take as much work off of
                                                the user as possible.


                                                When you open Tempo’s homepage, there are several categories to choose
                                                from, made by us, made for you and made by the community.
                                            </p>
                                            </br>

                                            <h2>Made by us</h2>
                                            <p>There are several types of breathing provided by the tempo app. It can be
                                                adapted to our current situation. Like when we are energized, we can
                                                choose to energize, or when we feel stressed we can choose the type of
                                                stress relief.

                                            <p>Made by you is the type that breathes that we make ourselves so that we
                                                can adjust to our wishes.

                                            <p>While developing this, there is a lot of consideration and iteration
                                                process to make it user friendly apps. Personally during this project I
                                                learned three things:

                                            <ul>
                                                <ol>Always listening users</ol>
                                                <ol>Don’t try to solve everything, or you’ll end up with nothing</ol>
                                                <ol>Don't focus on solutions, focus on problems</ol>
                                            </ul>
                                            During this process, me and my team often have discussions with Mr
                                            Philippelan so we can be really clear about what the user feels. There is
                                            also some feedback from tempo’s app.
