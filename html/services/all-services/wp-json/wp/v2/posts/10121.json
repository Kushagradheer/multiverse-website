However, it is important to remember that it went on for a long time and recovering from that was not a piece of cake. Their working was pretty involved; every taxi company had multiple operators designated to handle a stream of calls from different people in different cities.<\/p>\n<p>On the call, the caller would provide the information of their whereabouts, and the operator would then fill out the address of the caller in the system. Then locate the nearby taxi and allocate it for the caller by clicking \u201cDispatch\u201d on the side of the \u201cAvailable\u201d driver.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10126 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/how-on-demand-dispatch-app-cab-works.png\" alt=\"how on-demand dispatch app cab works\" width=\"750\" height=\"475\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It might sound simple as of now, but the truth is it was pretty hectic to manage the endless number of calls for operators all the time. Moreover, that kept on increasing with time, as the number of users increased. That reached out to a more complex version and at the end, less convenience.<\/p>\n<p>Now suppose, how simple would it be if the operator did not have to enter the location of every caller to find out the available taxis and answer them! It would become so much easier if all of this could happen on its own.<\/p>\n<p>Well, that is what started to happen. There were online platforms that have eased up this entire process of booking cabs or taxis. As everything happens automatically, and the risk of errors or mistakes has also decreased.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Challenges faced by the online taxi booking industry<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>In the pre-cloud era, when there were no big databases to handle all the complexities, the people had to install very complicated computer taxi dispatch app software on their systems to make the auto dispatch thing work.<\/p>\n<p>Also, it doesn\u2019t end there, the software came with an expiry date, after which they had to be purchased again, making it less reasonable. Since they were software, update happened naturally.<\/p>\n<p>When that took place, the working of the software would automatically go down for a while. Above anything, this proved to be a big mess for companies, as this would not the only aspect that they had to work upon.
