It is the technology which lets us enter an imaginative digital world in the real domain. It produces a creative world around ourselves, and we feel like the part of it. The <a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/augmented-reality-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">virtual reality app development<\/span><\/strong><\/a> has many applications. One of its uses is the construction industry.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h4>Let&#8217;s see the benefits of VR in the construction industry:<\/h4>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>3D Modeling<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10181\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/construction-technology-virtual-reality.jpg\" alt=\"construction technology 3d modelling vr\" width=\"750\" height=\"375\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Architects and Engineers use the <a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/bim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">BIM models<\/span><\/a> to represent their construction model. The BIM model is a blueprint of the real structure. With the help of the BIM model, we will come to know how the architecture will look like after the completion. It is what we call 3D modeling.<\/p>\n<p>VR plays a vital role in 3D modeling. With the help of VR, we can realize the 3D models of a building in real time. Also, we can show the customers the finished model of their homes when it is under construction. It is an excellent technology to raise the customers&#8217; experience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VR and customer experience<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>As explained, the VR technology lets us show the customers the modes of their homes. Moreover, we can also display the 3D models of other buildings like hospitals, schools, colleges, etc. to other clients. The VR technology will bring the vision of a client to the real life. They can see the live models of buildings before the construction.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>VR and professional training<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10179\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/construction-technology-live-training.png\" alt=\"construction technology vr professional training\" width=\"750\" height=\"568\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>VR is also helpful in professional training. It helps to save both time and money. With the help of VR, companies can provide the on-site job training to their employees without having an actual visit to the site. Hence, VR is useful not only to save the time but also to save the money.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from this, the fresh engineering graduates can also enjoy the live training experiences with the help of VR. It results in lowering the unemployment rate up to some extent.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read More:<\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a class=\"line\" style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-transforming-the-enterprises\/\">How Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are Transforming the Enterprises<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. <span class=\"line\">AR<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>AR refers to the Augmented Reality.
