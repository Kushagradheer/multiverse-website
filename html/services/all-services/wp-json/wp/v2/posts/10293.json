Try to use both simultaneously. You get to know how easy apps are and what extra features they have than the website.\u00a0 Many businesses have gained popularity due to their apps.<\/p>\n<p>For instance <strong>Zomato<\/strong>; it gained immense popularity from the app as the app offered natural food ordering features as well as reviewing features. There is the significant number of restaurants, bars, and cafes available in Zomato.<\/p>\n<p>The user can select the best one from reviews, ratings, images, number of check-ins, etc. Similarly, there are other apps which you will find in almost every smartphone: Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, Ola, Uber, Zomato, Bookmyshow, etc.<\/p>\n<p>All these apps are amazing and have come up with some great ideas and features. These great ideas need great capital too.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What are the factors to consider while deciding on the cost of an app<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. <span class=\"line\">Technology:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Every app needs at least one technology. Working on these technologies can be expensive in some cases. Developing apps need various platforms, frameworks, etc. <a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Top app developers<\/span><\/strong><\/a> need to buy these technologies and tools to build great apps.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. <span class=\"line\">Resources:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Developing an app requires skilled resources. To develop a mobile app these resources are needed: designers, developers, testers, marketing people, etc. Finding skilled resources is difficult.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. <span class=\"line\">Features:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Some features are way too expensive and extremely useful. Some features are mandatory to use and are costly.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. <span class=\"line\">Third-party app integration:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Many apps integrate third-party apps such as payout apps (Paytm, Tez, etc.) and GPS apps (Google maps). It requires money!<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. <span class=\"line\">Customer service:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Customer support centers support many apps that deal with customer data. These support services are 24&#215;7 active and offer a solution to all app related queries. Customer support services require different technologies, resources, inventory, etc.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. <span class=\"line\">Platform:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>iOS and android are two major platforms for app development. Developing apps for Apple and Android is different. Both have different policies, rules, etc. Cost varies on both platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Above are the significant factors affecting the <a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertzblog.wordpress.com\/2018\/09\/12\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-and-maintain-a-mobile-app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>cost of app development<\/strong><\/span><\/a>. If you are a part of the well-established app development company, you need not worry. However, if you want to start a mobile app development company, all you need is significant capital.<\/p>\n<p>Companies usually go with the loan option or funding option. Starting a business has some smart strategies, and one of these is never investing your own money in the business.<\/p>\n<p>When we talk about <a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">mobile app development<\/span><\/strong><\/a> business, there must be an idea first. Do developers need to analyze the idea that whether the idea has any scope? Are there any similar ideas already present in the market?<\/p>\n<p>What is the <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a class=\"line\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"http:\/\/findnerd.com\/list\/view\/Android-or-iOS-Which-is-the-best-platform-for-you-to-launch-your-app\/39513\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">best platform<\/a><\/span> to use for the app? Is the app maintainable? All these questions are immensely important to get confirmation on the development of that app.<\/p>\n<p>App prototype is developed first. There are two reasons. The first reason is to show this prototype to the end users and get their opinion. Another reason is to show this prototype to the funding companies.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10295 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/app-development-process.png\" alt=\"Angel Funding app prototype process\" width=\"750\" height=\"299\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What are the types of app prototypes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Low-Fidelity prototypes<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>High-Fidelity prototypes<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10294 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mobile-prototyping.jpg\" alt=\"type of app prototypes angel funding\" width=\"750\" height=\"471\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>First one is Low-Fidelity prototypes in which the functionalities are tested and not the visuals.
