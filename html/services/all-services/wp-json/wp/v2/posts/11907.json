It is because you will have your app development team with you. Not to mention the right app developer as well. An app developer is someone whom you hire to make your application an amazing one. So, make sure that you choose from the best. But how will you if you are not a person who is tech-savvy. Well, here is how.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\">Things To Know Before Hiring An Android App Developer<\/h2>\n<p>If you are on your way to hire mobile app developer for your Android applications, here are some of the things that you need to be aware of. Let\u2019s have a look.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">1. Test Their Knowledge About Android App Development<\/h3>\n<p>Many IT professionals out their might boast off their skills in Java and web development, all the while claiming that they are great web developers. Yet, these developers will not be able to perform well in the mobile platforms. So, the first thing that you need to think of is the knowledge of the developers in the Android development.<\/p>\n<p>You are creating a mobile app and not a web application, right? So, the app developer needs to be updated with the latest trends and technology in the <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/android-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>android app development<\/strong>.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">2. Get Them To Exhibit Samples Of Their Work<\/h3>\n<p>For every single professional app developer out there, a portfolio is a must. This is something that they need to have to let people know about their previous works and achievement. You need to get that from the developer that you are going to hire. This will give you an idea of whether they will be able to handle the task or not.<\/p>\n<p>Have a thorough look at the portfolio. If they have previously created any applications, then you need to test for the functionality of the apps. The user interface also is a very important thing to consider. Only after careful observation of these factors, you can hire the person for your <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">android app development company.<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">3. Have A Chat With The Previous Clients<\/h3>\n<p>You might not have an idea from the portfolio that who actually developed the application in the first place. So, you need to have a chat with the previous clients that they had. You could ask them for their opinion on the developer. There is nothing more authentic than a person\u2019s review, right? You could make queries about certain things such as whether the developer was able to make an on-time delivery or not. If he did then whether it was fruitful or not? These are some of the questions that will give you an idea about the experience and work ethic of the developer.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">4. Check The Platforms For Which The Developer Has Previously Worked<\/h3>\n<p>It might sound like a general piece of advice but it is certainly a very important one. Nowadays, both the Android and the iOS platforms have got a good reach on the people. So, hiring someone who has experience on both these platforms will be a good idea. This can save the time and effort that you put into the creation of the app.<\/p>\n<p>If you hire someone who is used to working on both these platforms, then they can create an app that will work for both Android as well as iOS. Here is a pro tip, choose a team of developers if you are creating apps for both iOS and Android platforms because it will increase the efficiency of your team.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">5. Check The Smartphones That They Are Using<\/h3>\n<p>You might be wondering what strange advice that seems. But then, it is can be equally important as anything else. Checking the smartphone of the developer will give you an idea about the preference of the developer. Say your developer tells you that they will create your android app. But, if they are not using one themselves, then how are they supposed to have an idea about the platform?<\/p>\n<p>An experienced developer would have an Android smartphone with different android apps installed in it. This way you can be sure whether the developer is up to the task or not. It surely doesn\u2019t seem like a piece of strange advice now, does it?<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">6. Decide A Route Of Communication With The Developer<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most important things to consider when you <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-dedicated-developers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hire app developer<\/a><\/strong><\/span> is the route of communication. It is a key element, especially when the developers are offshore. There are many cases where improper communication caused disastrous results when it came to app development. The quality of the app might not be to your liking if you aren\u2019t able to convey your needs and requirements to the developer.<\/p>\n<p>So, you need to ensure that there is a pretty strong medium of communication between you two. But, one thing that you need to see is whether the developer is actually able to carry out the actions that you communicate with them.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;\">7. Ensure The App Testing<\/h3>\n<p>Whether the developer will be able to create an app suitable for testing or not is another important criteria. Nowadays, the apps that are not tested cannot survive in the strongly competitive world. So, you need to make sure that you hire app developer who already has a plan in mind about the A\/B testing of the application. Without that, making any decision would be a blind mistake. If you don\u2019t want your app to fail, this is something that you have to consider before you hire a developer.<\/p>\n<p>In the very end, we would like to say that hiring a developer will not be that difficult if you consider these factors religiously. We hope that these tips were helpful for you and your app development company.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, you are thinking of starting your own android app development company?
