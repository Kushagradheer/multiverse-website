The dilemma doesn\u2019t lie on the app, but the processes used by the mobile apps company. There is no doubt about the fact that building mobile apps consists of a lot of procedures. The slightest mistake in any one of these can cause catastrophic results. But how can one avoid these mistakes?<\/p>\n<p>Following is a <a href=\"http:\/\/resources.idgenterprise.com\/original\/AST-0114203_iRiseCIO_wp0416_v2.pdf\">survey<\/a> constructed by IDG named Top CIO Challenges that Contribute to Enterprise Application Failure which provides us with some answers to why mobile apps fail.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Why Do Mobile Apps Fail? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The above-mentioned survey clearly asserts that mobile apps take a very high position in the to-do lists of enterprises. 60% of the total executives suggested that the app usability is the key for the app success. Also, 42% of the people had to say that user experience held a very important role too. These are some of the major contributors to the app success.<\/p>\n<p>Just accomplishing the objective of building an application is not enough for a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">mobile apps company<\/span><\/a><\/strong>. Ease of use and user experience is essential for success.<\/p>\n<p>An increase in mobile computing leads us to a world where hybrid mobile app development is very critical. Such was not the case about 10 years ago. That time, having bad user experience didn\u2019t affect the project in the worst way. However, the times have completely changed and the so has the expectations of the users. Nowadays, people expect more functionality and usability from an application. So, merely having a mobile app is not going to be enough to please them. You need to make sure that it does all that is possible.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>How Does One Begin with the App Rescue? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the most important questions that must be running through your mind is where to begin? Well, if you have a project that is burned to the ground, how do you start fixing it? We might know where the failures lie, but finding the solution is not easy. That is why the hybrid app development processes are here to help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Be Attentive And Listen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you get a failed app project. The people involved there are probably in a hole right now. What they need is your emotional and practical intelligence. Listen to the story that they have. This might provide you with the points where they went wrong in the project. Some people might be a bit guarded and not share the entire thing. The main agenda here is to build trust by being attentive. That way, you can get a hold of the problems easily.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Kick Off The Plan Of Rescue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you have a trusted relationship, it is time to share your plan of rescue. You need to make sure that you define the project properly. Share your vision and tactics to provide them with an idea. However, you need to make sure that the communication is proper as well. Honest feedback is very important.<\/p>\n<p>This is the point where the issues surface and your job is to solve them. Whether the problem lies in User Experience or usability, tackle the issue head-on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Assert The Decisions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bad decisions are the reason why the app projects fail in the first place. You have to make smarter and better decisions. That too, faster. It might sound like a simple word, but it holds more importance than you might think. The pressure certainly starts building with app project failures and the more you delay, the worse it will get.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Solving the Problems and Providing Solutions <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There can be many problems with the app failure. With the help of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/cross-platform-app-development\/\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">hybrid mobile app development<\/span><\/a><\/strong>, you can easily identify and correct these issues first-hand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Problem 1<\/strong>: Damaged User Experience and Data<\/p>\n<p>Very often, the goals for user experience and business goals are not the same. Although it happens unintentionally, the consequences are dire. Uninformed decisions and complicated processes make way for many issues in user experience. These issues can turn an app into a failure. Most companies try development and design solutions for solving the problem but don\u2019t have the right concept.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: Immediate UX Involvement<\/p>\n<p>It is essential to establish the user personas in a skillful way and that is where the UX experts come to help. Before the design and creation of an application, it is important to have the UX tested. You need to make sure that the UX solutions are properly integrated with the business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Problem 2<\/strong>: Technical Debt Due To a Broken Code-base<\/p>\n<p>All it takes is a tiny issue to get the entire project to fail. The foundation of a project lies in the technical aspects. Even the slightest mistake there can have terrible results. One such issue is the broken code-base which makes a mess of the things. It is essential to have technical documentation in order to get good results. However, it does take a lot of time as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: Proper Testing Of Technical Infrastructure<\/p>\n<p>You need to make sure that you invest time in the testing of automation and infrastructure. Have a proper plan for regression testing in order to achieve technical advancement. Also, ensure that the code-base that exists has a good audit as well. This way the prior mistakes can get full repair and mitigation options.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Conclusion: Making a Promise of Better Times <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>App projects failures are a common thing, to be honest. However, with right measures, the problems can get the repair that they require. It is essential to strategize while designing and building the applications.<\/p>\n<p>In an ideal world, no apps would fail and everything would go right from the beginning to the end. However, no mobile apps company is perfect like that. So, there are projects that do not make it to the endgame.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there is hope with the help of the development services that strive to produce the best results for the app companies. The only thing that holds importance here is identifying the issues and rectifying it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It happens many times that the app projects fail to convey the results that they should.
