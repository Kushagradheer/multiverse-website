In a similar way, every developer is essential in app development. An individual cannot perform complete tasks. Whether it&#8217;s a small project, it requires the team to work upon it. So how much these fantasy sports app developers cost? What are the criteria they work on? Let&#8217;s find out.<\/p>\n<p>The basic team consists of five entities that give their 100% to make the project a win-win deal.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>1. Project Manager:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> It is very necessary for one to see the entire process from beginning to end. The client must be updated with the current status of the project. This crucial task is taken in-charged by Project Manager. This super manager who is an intermediator between the team and the client took the note at every stage of the project and makes the completion before deadlines.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>2. Designers:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> The designers make sure that the app looks engaging and is easy in use. From color combinations to the arrangement of buttons on the mobile screen, the designers are responsible for the design and structure of the application. It is time-consuming because, at this stage, the client may take revisions for designs.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>3. Developer:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> Developer gives life to the designs by the designers. The lines of codes are written to add functionalities and various other features. The developer potters the application by coding all the required features.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>4. Back-end developer:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> After the application is developed, it is very important to know whether the app is compatible with the database or not. To ensure the correct connectivity, the back-end developer keeps the check on the application connectivity with the server and database.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>5. Tester:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> It observes the quality of code sections and assures the outcome meets all the requirements.<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"row\"><strong>Team Member<\/strong><\/th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Duties<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Hourly Cost<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"row\"><strong>Project Manager<\/strong><\/th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Bridges the Gap between development team and client requirements<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">$20+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"row\"><strong>Developer<\/strong><\/th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Create Logic and implement them with code<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">$30+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"row\">Back-end-Developer<\/th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Maintain the database, server and app<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">$25+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"row\"><strong>Designer<\/strong><\/th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Creates a user interactive interface<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">$15+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"row\"><strong>Tester<\/strong><\/th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">ensures bug free app delivery before and after launch<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">$20+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 37px; color: #0000ff;\">Factors Affecting Cost of an App<\/h2>\n<p>Designs are the soul of the app development. A better user interface always leads to a successful app. In <a href=\"\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">mobile application development<\/a>, design consists of logos, wireframes, visual, color combinations, etc. App designing plays a vital role in cost estimation. The factors impacting the cost are:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>1. Geography:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> It is observed that the rates may differ from where the developer belongs to. Comparing to Indian fantasy sports app developers, the US developer costs quite high. The cost for the designers and developers varies from country to country.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>2. Complexity:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The more features and functionalities you add to the application, the more the complex it will get. When the complex apps require a brilliant experience and therefore, the complex apps lead to high charges by app developers.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>3. Android\/iOS:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>iPhone developers are less in number as compared to Android developers. Android development is a simple-command and run development whereas the iPhone requires tough level coding. Therefore, Android app development charges less whereas iPhone developer demands high.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\"><strong>4. Ionic:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p> The development in ionic runs on both Android and iOS platforms. The coding is complex and requires a lot of experience. One time of coding and get your app runs on both the platforms (android and iOS). It is obvious that Ionic development is expensive than android\/iOS.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 37px; color: #0000ff;\">Final Verdict<\/h2>\n<p>Here are all the details about the features which you need to have in your application. The fantasy cricket app development process is not easy, but it is not impossible as well. Fantasy sports mobile apps have a bright prospect in the coming days.
