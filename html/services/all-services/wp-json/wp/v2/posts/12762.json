Follow these steps to create a stunning website using Joomla 3.4.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Joomla Admin Interface<\/h3>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12763\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/joomla-admin-interface.jpg\" alt=\"joomla-admin-interface\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Download the setup file for the Joomla 3.4 and install it on your personal computer. There are two different ways by which you can install it &#8211; manual or direct installation. It is recommended that you go with the direct installation for safe and stable service. If you cannot carry these processes, then simply ask a Joomla development company for helping you out in creating the website you want.<\/p>\n<p>Once installed, you need to understand the Admin Interface from where most of the work will be done. The menu at the top of this window contains all the major administrator functions and features. On the left, the sidebar has the tools required to manage the website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The 6 major sections of the Admin Interface that are of most importance &#8211;<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>System<\/strong> &#8211; Once the user enters this section, they can get the Global Configuration option. You can easily change the settings which will affect the whole website and other aspects. The site, system, filters and even the server can be modified from here. Once you are done, you can easily come back to the control panel with a single click.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>Users<\/strong> &#8211; With the help of Joomla 3.4 you can allow multiple users to access a single website. By using the User option, you can give Super User access to anyone you want to. The Super User can add other users and grant them different levels of access.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>Menus<\/strong> &#8211; This option allows you to create and manage different navigation menu on the website.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>Content<\/strong> &#8211; As the name suggests, with the Content option you can create and modify articles and blogs. You can also make featured articles and manage all the other media files.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>Components<\/strong> &#8211; From here you can access the different functional elements of the website like banners, news feed etc.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>Extensions<\/strong> &#8211; Extensions are a great way to make your website more interesting and efficient. Different templates, plugins, and languages are easily accessible with this option.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Installing a Joomla Template<\/h3>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12764\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/installing-a-joomla-template.jpg\" alt=\"installing-a-joomla-template\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Joomla Templates are available in the Extensions tab. You need to install a template before carrying on with other aspects of the website. Here are the steps required to install a template in Joomla.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">First, you will need to click on Extensions.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Then select the Extensions Manager.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Now, browse for the template you want to install.<\/li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Select and click on upload to install the template.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Joomla comes with three other different options to install a template from the Extensions tab.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the Web &#8211; Joomla 3.4 allows you to directly install a template from the Joomla Extension Directory.<\/li>\n<li>The Directory &#8211; You can also install an extension in Joomla provided you know the given path of the directory.<\/li>\n<li>Using an URL &#8211; To add a template or any other extension, users can enter the URL and upload it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you have selected the template, you will need to activate it. First, go to the Extensions tab and select the Template Manager. In the Manager screen, search for the template or extension file and make it the default template. You can do it by clicking on the star symbol. The template will activate on the website in a few seconds.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Add the desired content<\/h3>\n<p>As soon as the template is ready, your website is now ready to host your desired content. In Joomla 3.4, the term Article is used rather than content. So how are you going to add your content on your website? First, on the left sidebar of the Joomla control panel, you will need to select \u201cAdd New Article\u201d. Once you click on it, you will have to create the content along with a suitable heading. You can make your content interesting by adding pictures, infographics, etc. Once you are finished with the content click on \u201cSave &amp; Close\u201d option available in the menu manager.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-joomla-developer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12768\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/hire-joomla-developer-add.jpg\" alt=\"hire-joomla-developer-add\" width=\"750\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Creating the Menu<\/h3>\n<p>If you do not add the article you created on the menu, it will fail to appear on the website. Joomla 3.4 gives you the choice to go with the default menu or create your own. If you want to create your own menu, go to Menu Manager and click on \u201cAdd New Menu\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Add the title for this new menu and click on \u201cSave &amp; Close\u201d. Once the menu is ready, you will be able to add the content. Click on \u201cMenus\u201d and then select New Menu. Then click on\u201cAdd New Menu Items\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Adding the Module<\/h3>\n<p>Now we are at the final step of the overall process. Adding the module is an important step. First, you will need to go to Extensions and then click on Module Manager. In the Manager screen, you will get the option to create a \u201cNew\u201d module. When the pop-up page appears, select the menu.<\/p>\n<p>Give a unique title to the module and select your menu. After these steps are complete, go to Positions and make sure to select the final position for the menu. That&#8217;s it! On the website, you will be able to see the menu, module and also the content which you created. <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Joomla web development<\/span> services will surely cover all these aspects that we mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>So here are the important steps that you will need to follow in order to create a website using Joomla 3.4.
