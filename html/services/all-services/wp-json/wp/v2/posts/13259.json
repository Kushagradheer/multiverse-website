And with this blog post, all other details will be taken care of. Let\u2019s dive in to know more!<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 6% 0px 0px 0px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Business Need\u00a0for\u00a0React Native<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Applications coded with a strong JavaScript cannot have a better competition, except building a mobile application of course. JavaScript acts as a base which gets us to build any kind of web applications and use of which wasn&#8217;t possible for developing native mobile apps. Learning any kind of programming language including Objective C or Java was a must.<\/p>\n<p>It was when Facebook\u2019s React Native was launched when the barrier was broken. If the advantages of React Native are to be referred to, combinations of various mind-blowing features were put up together such as developing cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. You are no longer required to write two different coding for just a single app for the sake of its availability in both the operating systems. A <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-react-native-developer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>React Native App Development<\/strong><\/span><\/a> company provides assistance in this field. A lot of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appbrain.com\/stats\/libraries\/details\/react_native\/react-native\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top apps contain React Native<\/a> and are running successfully today.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 6% 0px 0px 0px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Introduction to React Native<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Here is an introduction to the world of advancement beyond our expectations. A sneak-peek into what React Native has been assigned to perform.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Building the React Native apps<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Using React Native you can code any application for both Android as well as iOS using JavaScript. What is fascinating from a coder\u2019s perspective is now the usage of all the specifically designed built-in features like camera, gestures, locations, and push notifications will be easy. The mobile applications building industry has diverse JavaScript library and among them are, <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/cloud-computing-with-phonegap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PhoneGap<\/a><\/strong><\/span> or Ionic. But the barriers contained within them are &#8211; they are webview based and the applications are not natives built.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Developing cross-platform apps for mobile (Android and iOS)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Building applications now are easier than ever. Previously, a coder had to code one application, two times, with two different codes i.e. coding had to be done in swift for iOS and in JavaScript or Kotlin for Android. The procedure of building apps has been shortened by Facebook\u2019s React Native. You can now create your app using React Native, it will run in any mobile device irrespective of the operating system. This is an <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"http:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/videos\/f8-2016\/building-cross-platform-mobile-apps-with-react-native\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">open source technology software<\/a> that can build world-class applications very efficiently.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write the code using React Native and JavaScript<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you are working on applications in React Native, you will deal with JavaScript. React Native apps are built up using JavaScript and using which you can create a great user-interface component.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 6% 0px 0px 0px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">How To Start Development?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You have to get started simply by installing the application. But it can be a lot more complicated than you think.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using expo-cli<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Perfect for beginners. Newbies should start building apps through this Command Line tool. Expo-cli comes with numerous options. Using this way, React Native boilerplate can be downloaded and installed, integrated with expo API. You can install and test the app on a mobile phone without the need for configuration. To open up your app using expo mobile app, just scan a QR code. For enhanced understanding and comparison, you can check on the <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react-native\/showcase\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">other applications<\/a> built via React Native.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using react-native-cli<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Job done by react-native-cli is just the same if compared to expo-cli. Though variation can be measured in terms of advantages which is possessed by react-native-cli. Through this way having access to customization is an add-on, i.e. one can create his required native modules using the available options. You will have access to use all the tools which will affect the native modules. And in order to get the best of the features available, make sure you contact experts who would be provided by a React native app development company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"get_quote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/customize-your-own-react-native-app-today.jpg\" alt=\"hire-taxi-app-developer\" width=\"750\" height=\"100\" align=\"center\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 6% 0px 0px 0px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Building an App For Both the OS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just like other aspects, you have a set of requirements too, which have to be installed in order to commence with app building. Start by downloading and configuring Android Studio and Android SDK. Then installation of some APIs is required too.<\/p>\n<p>The procedure for the same is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style: circle;\">Open the Android Studio<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: circle;\">Click on the settings tab<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: circle;\">Tick mark the platform that React Native will be supporting in the SDK platform (for an instance, Android latest version)<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: circle;\">Go to SDK tools<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: circle;\">Check Android SDK Build-Tools, Android SDK tools, and the Google Play service<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: circle;\">Under the option, Android SDK Build-Tools choose the platforms: Starting from 19.0.0 to 20.0.0, 22.0.0 to 24.0.0, 25.0.2 , 26.0.1 to 26.0.3 and 28.0.1 to 28.02<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Test your app in the emulator which is a medium where one has to run and test the app. There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/studio\/run\/emulator\" rel=\"nofollow\">requirements and regulations<\/a> to run apps on the emulator. There are combinations of emulators available as well. You can be better off with Android Studio\u2019s Emulators or you may for a change go for Genymotion or real devices.<\/p>\n<p>This is all you need to do for Android application building. But how to do this in iOS? Here is the fix, the app which you built and tested keeping in view the Android features, will also run in an iOS. There are some exceptions though, you require a MacOS if you wish for the resulted app to run in iOS devices. This is all you require, no additional dependencies are needed by iOS for running React Native.<\/p>\n<p>But, if you aspire to know the best emulators, Xcode is the one you are looking for. Mac has the capability of running both Android and iOS but it is the opposite for any other normal PC which has an android emulator installed in it. So, it is quite useful if you to own a MacOS and that is where all the work should be done.<\/p>\n<p>On an end note, with all the requirements being met, you can start writing reactjs code. All you need to do is learn some basics to build strong iOS\/Android applications. You are all fine with up till now, but make sure you check on the errors which can pop up anywhere and debug them. This is also a very crucial part i.e. debugging of errors.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you a business professional looking for an React Native app development company?
