Let\u2019s start by understanding the basics.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">About Cryptocurrency<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency became popular after the inception of Bitcoin. The first-ever cryptocurrency, as we all know is Bitcoin. Its launch took place publicly through an anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Later, cryptocurrency and blockchain gained a prominence. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bitcoin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bitcoin<\/a> is the most popular blockchain technology. Its global value reached <a href=\"http:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/292814\/global-value-of-virtual-currencies-by-currency\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">10.1 trillion USD<\/a> in 2014. Today its price index has reached <a href=\"http:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/326707\/bitcoin-price-index\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3,799.68 USD<\/a>. This marked the beginning of cryptocurrency exchange development companies.<\/p>\n<p>The blockchain is a public ledger under which cryptocurrencies work. Cryptocurrency is the exchange of electronic money. It is decentralized or is independent of a central authority. This is an open-source code that gets shared on the ledger. It has a definite value and is sent from one user to another. Exchange of cryptocurrency is called cryptocurrency mining. This completes the verification process and adds transaction data into the ledger.<\/p>\n<p>So the future of cryptocurrency is an important topic to discuss. As this will aid developers in blockchain app development.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">The future of cryptocurrency through experts perspective<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13768\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/the-future-of-cryptocurrency-through-experts-perspective-1.jpg\" alt=\"the-future-of-cryptocurrency-through-experts\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blockchain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blockchain<\/a> for cryptocurrencies is based on electronic currency and e-payments. Other applications can also use this technology. A lot of institutions around the world including hotels, airlines accept the digital currency. This has created a situation that excludes the intermediation of central authority which, in turn, raises questions about the global economy and financial markets. All these topics are added here along with expert guidance.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on the political state:<\/h3>\n<p>The political organizational state anywhere is dynamic. This is mainly due to uncertain occurrences like deflation or inflation. This definitely makes the use of digital currency essential. In such cases, it becomes a source of monetary fund. People are financially stable even in such conditions. They bring price stability and sustains the country without crashing economy. This is a modern way of dealing with problems within the country. Although its institutional structure is new, blockchain app development can help. Plenty of developers are working hard to achieve excellence in creating these apps.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on consumers and government policies:<\/h3>\n<p>A big challenge for digital currency is government policies. They are an alternative to traditional currencies. This is possible when flexible policies are formed. This is difficult as the government earns revenue through paper money printing. Also, they have the authority to control the economy. This increases the chances of the government trying to oppose its use. It also depends upon the consumers. Today, a large population of the world is shifting towards digital currency. A number of retailers, companies, and services accept <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/develop-mobile-wallet-app\/\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">digital wallet<\/span> <\/a>currency today. So this certainly determines the future of cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on value:<\/h3>\n<p>Digital currency can surely replace the existing forms of payments. But experts say that this is highly dependent upon its value. Consumers expect the value to be relative to traditional currencies. So that people become aware of it. If a large population is investing in successful cryptocurrencies, that will attract people. The central authority will automatically allow its use when demand is high. So <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/cryptocurrency-exchange-development\/\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Bitcoin trading software<\/span><\/a> and companies should focus on increasing value. This will sustain the blockchain network. Indeed, it will replace traditional currencies soon if the value increases.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on ease of usage:<\/h3>\n<p>Blockchain and digital currencies have a major advantage of anonymity. Along with this, it provides a record of every transaction. This reduces the use of credit\/debit cards worldwide. Also, it brings down the overall costs of transaction fees. This is a big plus point for consumers. On the other hand, there is a chance of developing deep negative interest rates. Experts believe that cryptocurrency can lessen the cost of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fiat_money\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiat money<\/a>. So there will be no need to make any modifications with them. This poses a restriction for the government to earn revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on current usage:<\/h3>\n<p>Today a number of products and services are using the electronic currency. Small-scale fund transactions, selling of digital media products are examples. They make good revenue. Most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin comes with a fixed limit. This engages a lot of people to invest in it. Also, cryptocurrency makes the establishment of global supply chains easier. This has a lot of scope in the future. It can encourage companies to transact with digital money. Again they think cryptocurrency is advantageous due to anonymity. However, some experts think that limiting the use of digital currency is bad. This aspect is determined only on how people see it in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on security:<\/h3>\n<p>It is easy to develop a cryptocurrency clone script based on Bitcoin exchange software. Thus, the security of developing applications is questionable. As the script is available, the security of the entire blockchain network reduces. This is a challenge for cryptocurrency exchange development companies. Hence, this becomes a strong reason for the government to oppose cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00b7Based on the new development:<\/h3>\n<p>After Bitcoin, other digital currencies like Litecoin, Ripple developed. This means that there is constant development in blockchain technology. Applications are built with the motto of being an alternative to others. So new currencies developed in the future can outwit existing digital systems. They may be quicker and have more security. Hence, this will increase competition. The government will also try to implement policies for competition. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It may be advantageous for the government but pressurizes developers and companies at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related Article: <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/how-to-setup-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-software\/\">How To Setup A Cryptocurrency Exchange Software?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Limitations of Cryptocurrency<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are few limitations or challenges faced by blockchain technology.

This is because cryptocurrency involves a large number of complexities. This is the major reason for the denial of digital currency on a massive scale.<\/p>\n<p>There is a limitation for using the electronic currency. That is the deletion of digital money due to a system crash. In the future, developers may bring new technological advances to overcome this aspect. Hence, this will surely multiply the number of consumers.<\/p>\n<p>If the features of digital currency become acceptable, then they raise a number of issues like hacking. There are chances of the central authority to involve and regulate its rules. Hence this eventually vanishes the purpose of creating a cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"mega-menu-link get_quote\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/cryptocurrency-exchange-software-banner-add.jpg\" alt=\"cryptocurrency-exchange-software\" width=\"750\" height=\"100\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now how do developers deal with limitations and challenges?
