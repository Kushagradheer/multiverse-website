Especially when you are in the middle of an urgent meeting or something like that. According to the stats, in the year 2018, India is the 2nd most spam plagued nation in the world. Brazil is taking the lead with over 37.5 spam calls in a month, with an increase of 81% from last year.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, telecom operators are the major source of spam calls and SMS in India. They are solely responsible for 91% spam calls in the country. Telecom customers were literally fed up of these calls and SMS and started demanding a solution to this issue. It was high time when the <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-dedicated-developers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app developers<\/a> <\/span>started searching for applications that can filter these unwanted incomings.<\/p>\n<p>Some revolutionary apps like Truecaller, PRANK DIAL, Call Spoofer, and many more were introduced to the world. A caller ID App can help you in many ways. Unfortunately, spammers too have turned smart and started using computer generated numbers to spoof the actual numbers they are calling from. They generally have the first few digits of phone number similar to yours, to make it look familiar to you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important Note:<\/strong> There is a difference between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/08\/15\/smarter-living\/how-to-block-spam-calls-texts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">scammers and spammers<\/a>. Remember not all the spam messages contain scams. Scams are sent to trick the user to disclose your personal information. It is more into stealing and frauds.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What is a Caller ID app?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A caller ID app is <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mobile app solutions<\/a><\/span> designed exclusively to identify and control unwanted or spam calls and SMS. According to a report published by <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/business\/india-business\/telcos-made-91-of-spam-calls-in-india-in-2018-report-says\/articleshow\/67143642.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Truecaller<\/a>, one of the best caller ID app, spam calls in India has doubled since the last year.<\/p>\n<p>Despite various regulations issued by TRAI, Indians are yet to receive respite from these spam calls and messages.

The app then merges the uploaded contact list with its existing phone detail database. On a successful signing up process, the user can easily search phone numbers on the app and can look at their current location and other details. All the caller ID apps come with a <a href=\"https:\/\/7labs.io\/mobile\/how-truecaller-works.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">live caller identification feature<\/a>. This enables the user to see the identity and location of an incoming call. Answering or rejecting the call is at the discretion of the user thereafter.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"get_quote\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10411 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/get-ready-to-go-solution-for-your-App-like-Truecaller-Now.jpg\" alt=\"Truecaller app development\" width=\"750\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Caller ID apps receive this information in a two-fold approach. They store a list of top spammers in the user\u2019s mobile phone to enable the users in identifying spam calls and SMS even without an internet connection.<br \/>\nIf you find an incoming call from a non-listed number, live lookup feature comes for the rescue. The user can see the details on his main screen. Live caller identification requires an active internet or <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/gps-vs-beacons-vs-wi-fi-let-android-app-development-help-the-best-location-identifier-win-the-battle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Wi-Fi<\/span><\/a> connection.<\/p>\n<p>Note: You might receive certain calls even after marked as spam from the companies you have earlier dealt with. For instance, receiving verification calls on the purchase of a new SIM card from spam marked numbers is quite common.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">The best alternative to Apps like Truecaller for Android and iPhone<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In the market, there are various alternative presents to the Truecaller application.

Focus on the expectations of the users and try to incorporate them into your app. Plan and design your app according to user preferences.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Mobile Platform<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are two major mobile platforms in the world; iOS and Android. You must be clear in your planning which platform you will be choosing to launch your app. iOS apps include Objective-C or Swift coding language. Whereas, Andriod applications include Kotlin or Java coding language. Though you can also go for a combined app for both platforms with the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/why-is-xamarin-the-best-for-cross-platform-app-development-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xamarin<\/a>, Ionic, etc.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Database\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Millennials won\u2019t have enough time to bear any lags in the modern day apps. They will not think twice before uninstalling unresponsive apps. So you must make sure you have a speedy database to ensure an efficient app performance. Considers factors like size of data required to be stored, data structure, accessibility, security, and scalability of data to make this happen.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Payments\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We live in a virtual world where artificial intelligence is no more a new concept. You must develop an advanced app that accepts payments from various online modes as most of the users prefer to pay through online modes.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Security<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most important factors that should be kept in mind while designing a mobile app. Smartphones have a lot of personal information like bank details, pictures, passwords, etc. Broken cryptography, poor authentication, data leakages, and so on are some common security challenges in an inefficient app. You need to be extra vigilant with this one in your caller ID app development process!<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Future Prospects<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Last but not least! Design an app that holds strong future prospects for your company. Making an app for short term gains is not a good idea. You need to analyze its future before starting the project. Taking inspiration from apps like Truecaller can be a great help.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Additional Perk:<\/h3>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/build-a-finance-management-app-like-mint\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14099 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/build-your-own-feature-rich-finance-management-app-1.jpg\" alt=\"build-your-own-feature-rich-finance-management-app\" width=\"750\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What should be the Essential Features in your Caller ID App?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14098\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/what-should-be-the-essential-features-in-your-caller-id-app.jpg\" alt=\"what-should-be-the-essential-features-in-your-caller-id-app\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to develop a caller ID app, you have ample of features to incorporate in it.
