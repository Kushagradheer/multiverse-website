With so many tools and software, it\u2019s easier than ever to manage more in less time. With so much competition to create more and more, these new trends are timely.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re hoping to become a better project manager, you need to stay up to date on the latest and greatest trends. The better you\u2019re able to use these to your advantage, the more you\u2019re able to accomplish. Whether you\u2019re managing a team, your own business, or a personal project, these trends are for you. Let\u2019s make 2019 the year of doing more. Here are the 5 biggest project management trends shaping 2019.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14612\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/5-biggest-project-management-trends.jpg\" alt=\"5 biggest project management trends\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>1. Big Data and Data Management<\/h3>\n<p>Big data is one of the biggest trends for all industries, but it\u2019s especially impactful in the world of project management. <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-use-big-data-analytics-in-mobile-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Big data<\/a> is a term used to describe large volumes of data. This data is used to accomplish more, learn from past efforts, and create better products or services geared towards audiences.<\/p>\n<p>While project managers aren\u2019t necessarily delving deep into the world of managing this big data through data management, they are welcoming a data-driven approach to tasks. We see this reflected in the data-driven tools of today. Solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlassian.com\/software\/jira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JIRA<\/a> that present data in a clear, easy to use way are making a big impact. We\u2019re likely to see more uses of data within organizational structures in the near future.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14613\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/trello.png\" alt=\"trello\" width=\"928\" height=\"456\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Cloud-Based Solutions<\/h3>\n<p>Cloud solutions are everywhere you look. From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/drive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Drive<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dropbox<\/a>, companies, and individuals alike are joining the cloud-revolution. The pros of using cloud solutions are endless. Not only is it easy to take your projects and files on the go, but it\u2019s much safer than leaving all of your important documents on a local drive.<\/p>\n<p>Cloud-based solutions are secure, collaborative, and hear to stay. It\u2019s unusual to find an organization that isn\u2019t already using cloud-solutions, but this year should be the final for making the transition once and for all. Cloud-based solutions are in all industries, from tech logging to product creation (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/papertrailapp.com\/log-aggregator\">https:\/\/papertrailapp.com\/log-aggregator<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>3. Staying Agile<\/h3>\n<p>Agile solutions stem from the Agile methodology. This is becoming a standard way for conducting projects and much of this push is from the tech-focused switch to <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/devops-custom-software-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps<\/a>. The Agile methodology sounds complicated, but it\u2019s just a way to get more done by focusing on flexibility, collaboration, and several short rounds of development.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, instead of working on multiple projects at once, there\u2019s now a focus on working on one aspect at a time. This keeps workplaces and individuals more focused on productivity and engagement. In a world with so many new things, the Agile methodology tries to cut through the noise.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Remote Management<\/h3>\n<p>Remote working is on the rise, especially with younger generations like Millennials and Generation Z. These young people are quickly changing the landscape of the modern workplace by working remotely and thriving. While this might seem like it would decrease productivity, it\u2019s actually the opposite. For small business employees, <a href=\"https:\/\/remote.co\/10-stats-about-remote-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">86% of them reported<\/a> working alone at home will help them reach peak productivity.<\/p>\n<p>New collaborative tools make it easier to manage remote teams than ever before. Tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/monday.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monday<\/a>, Asana, and even Trello are based on collaboration, productivity, and project management. As remote work becomes more common, project management trends introduce new ways to increase productivity beyond borders.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14614\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/monday.png\" alt=\"monday\" width=\"1151\" height=\"584\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. New Soft Skills<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, one of the last trends in project management in 2019 is the demand for so-called soft skills. Soft skills are usually overlooked, particularly in the world of hiring, but they\u2019re suddenly being called to the forefront. Employers and hiring managers alike are searching for skills like emotional intelligence, collaboration, and communication to drive their own company culture.<\/p>\n<p>Project managers aren\u2019t expected to have solely tech skills. Instead, there\u2019s a new push for these soft skills that truly create a compelling, successful workplace. This is a great trend that means new leaders are able to rise to the forefront of project management. As projects become more complex in 2019, having these new skills will create new ways to solve even more challenging problems.<\/p>\n<h3>The New Age of Project Management<\/h3>\n<p>Project management is evolving and becoming more inclusive. From remote work to new soft skills, there is room for more people than ever before in the project management space. No matter your industry, these project management trends will help you accomplish more with less time, money, and effort.<\/p>\n<p>Staying organized, flexible, and agile are more vital than ever before. Are you prepared for the new age of project management?
