Every business requires a particular set of basic features and some customized advance features to fulfill the objective of their application development for their business.<\/p>\n<p>For example, features like sign up, registration, menu, order, etc. are some of the basic features in an on-demand food delivery app. However, features like GPS navigational system, <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/11-best-payment-processing-libraries-for-your-ios-app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">multiple payment gateways<\/span><\/a>, admin panel, security, etc. are advanced features that require the meticulous implementation of codes to ensure the safe and secure operation of the app.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: As the complexity of features increases, the cost of iOS app development also increases.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">Cost \u03b1 Complexity of Features<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 30px;\">Factor 2: UI\/UX Designing<\/h4>\n<p>Designing a presentable layout for your application is necessary to create an interactive user experience.

Reducing cost does not mean that at any step of the iOS app development, the quality of the final outcome will be compromised.<\/p>\n<p>Following are some of the key points that ensure that cost optimization can be done while developing an iOS app.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t rush for launching an app with bugs left unattended:<\/strong> Most of us want to launch our mobile application as soon as possible and thus, we miss the minute mistakes that later own requires application update. Remember, app update adds to iOS app development costs. Thus, always check and test your application for quality and bug-free operation. It is not advisable to update your app as soon as the app release.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use Cross-Platform app development:<\/strong> If you are planning to run your application on multiple platforms then use platforms like Xamarin to develop a hybrid app that shares code for both iOS and Android platform. However, if you are not focusing on multiple platform app development then you can opt for Swift 5 language to design and develop your iOS application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><em><strong>\u201cSome Additional Knowledge\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>Swift 5:<\/em><\/strong><em> It offers interactive and developer friendly code, the syntax is concise and Swift offers secure and safe code to design.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> <img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-14898 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/NewSwift5-feature.png\" alt=\"New Swift5-feature\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/swift\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Features of Swift 5<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/span><strong><em>:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; Faster code as String re-implemented with UTF-8 encoding.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; Performance boost up in Dictionary and Set.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; Offering unique access to memory<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><\/em><em>&#8211; Supports dynamic collaboration with languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">&#8211; Cost of iOS App Development<\/h3>\n<p>According to the clutch survey, an expert iOS app development agency charge approx., $171,000 for creating a full-fledged application. Whereas a leading app development company offering a dozen of customizing features may charge between $100,000 and $500,000.<\/p>\n<p>A small or startup company may charge around $10,000 &#8211; $40,000 for basic app features. The cost of development also depends on the type of application you want to develop and for which industry vertical. If you want to develop an application for eCommerce business, then you need to implement a more secure platform for protecting and securing payment gateways.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas, for a social media platform like Facebook, Instagram, etc. you need to implement a two-way security system to ensure user data is protected.
