Lowest Transaction Fees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Various crypto exchange platforms charge different transaction fees. For example, Coinbase charges all the transactions at a set base rate of 4% but waves a part of the conversion fee based on the payment method used. The famous Coinbase pro or GDAX platform charges a 0.10%-0.30% taker fee as well as 0% maker fee. On the other hand, Binance charges around 0.1% trading fee. Another famous name in Crypto market, Kraken\u2019s maker fee varies from 0.0-0.16% based on the volume, and the taker fees range between 0.10-0.26%.

But in simple terms, cryptocurrency and cryptomarkets are one of the many applications of <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/steemit.com\/blockchain\/@theninehertz\/the-new-disruption-in-world-of-technology-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blockchain technology<\/a><\/strong><\/span>. Also, blockchain technology has revolutionized the concept of data transfer. Every individual block comprises of three things: a cryptographic hash of the existing block, a timestamp, and data involved in the current transaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Blockchain: All You Need To Know<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. The term \u201cblockchain\u201d refers to a publicly available worldwide database that is encrypted and loaded with many security features.<\/p>\n<p>2. The working of blockchain is simple to understand. It allows users across the globe to add information to a database and data is spread over a network. Thus, it ensures that no data gets corrupted.<\/p>\n<p>3. The data is continuously flowing over a network, and no copy of data gets stored at a particular location or server.<\/p>\n<p>4. The continuous flow of data over a network ensures that data is not altered from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>5. Blockchain technology has revolutionized the concept of <strong><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.kinja.com\/empower-your-data-security-with-blockchain-and-iot-1833634586\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data security<\/a><\/span><\/strong> as no other technology permitted the free flow of data over a network without storing them on the servers.<\/p>\n<p>6. Besides, this technology is an open-source software which allows everyone to create their blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>7. The complete blockchain model is decentralized, and a single party doesn&#8217;t have control over it.<\/p>\n<p>8. Therefore, the data once submitted can\u2019t be manipulated again by the third-party users.<\/p>\n<p>With the invention of Bitcoin in the year 2008 along with blockchain sector, people started to develop their cryptocurrencies across the globe with the help of <strong><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/reasons-for-increase-in-the-demand-for-cryptocurrency-exchange-developers-in-2019-892fabaae2d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cryptocurrency exchange developer<\/a><\/span><\/strong>.\u00a0Thus, a broad crypto market flourished over the years and investors began to make investments in this field.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, around 700 digital currencies are existing all over the World Wide Web. Though most of these cryptocurrencies are not-so-popular, nobody can suspect what comes next! Each Crypto Exchange has its own set of features like the commission cost, limitation, currencies they allow to trade, etc.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">WORKING:<\/h3>\n<p>The following image depicts the in-depth view of a simple Crypto Exchange Software:<\/p>\n<p>1. The Crypto Exchange Software allows multiple users across the globe to connect to a secure network.<\/p>\n<p>2. When someone requests a transaction, the request for a peer-to-peer connection is set up.<\/p>\n<p>3. The individual computer involved in p-2-p connection is known as a node.<\/p>\n<p>4. Multiple nodes validate the user\u2019s requested transaction based on the known set algorithm. A valid cryptocurrency transaction involves transfer, record, buying or selling of cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>5. Multiple transactions are combined to form a new block of data.<\/p>\n<p>6. The next step consists of the addition of the new block to the existing blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>7. Once, the block gets added to the existing blockchain; the data is permanent and unalterable.<\/p>\n<p>8. Finally, the transaction is complete.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">Characteristics of Crypto Exchange Software:<\/h3>\n<p>While developing a stable crypto exchange software, it is necessary to incorporate the following characteristics:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Security:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is essential for any exchange to come with state-of-art security and encryption practices. It wasn\u2019t a long time ago, the news of hacking of South Korean Exchange Bithumb shocked every crypto trader. The total loss was estimated to be somewhere around $31.6 billion. Also, security is essential to protect the identity of the user and prevent data loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Supported Cryptocurrencies:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is vital that Exchange provides users with a one-place destination for trading in all cryptocurrencies and tokens. Since investors don\u2019t have time to switch from one platform to another.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Fees and Commissions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every trader wants to book the maximum profit. So, it is necessary that an exchange doesn\u2019t charge high fees and commission as transaction charges can cost a fortune in high-volume trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Mode of Payment:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Adding multiple payment options ensure more flexibility for traders. Some of the standard modes of payment are cash, credit cards, wire transfer, pay through PayPal, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Geographic Location:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since the laws and the legislature policies differ from place-to-place. The geographic location and laws governing the area also plays a vital role in setting up crypto exchange markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Ease of Use:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since the crypto traders can\u2019t spend their valuable time learning a sophisticated financial instrument. It\u2019s essential that the website or application comes with an easy-to-use interface.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Cost of Launching Cryptocurrency Exchange:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14983\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Cost-of-Launching-Cryptocurrency-Exchange.png\" alt=\"Crypto Markets vs Internet Users\" width=\"749\" height=\"329\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The report suggests that the cost of launching Coinbase, one of the pioneer cryptocurrency exchange website is somewhere around in the range of USD 57,000 to USD 98,000.<\/p>\n<p>The total cost of launching both website and application for a cryptocurrency exchange platform will cost between USD 1,32,000 to USD 1,45,000.<\/p>\n<p>The costs mentioned above are approximate figures.
