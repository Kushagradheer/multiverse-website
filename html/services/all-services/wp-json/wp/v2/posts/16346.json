Well, before that, it is essential to know all the responsibilities of the iPhone app developers. The main function of the iOS app developers is to develop, design, and implement certain iOS apps and products. The roles of the app developers are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Researching, designing, developing, and implementing different iOS programs.<\/li>\n<li>Testing and evaluation of different iOS applications.<\/li>\n<li>Analyzing the needs and requirements of the users who need specific adjustments to the applications.<\/li>\n<li>Designing and developing apps that meet the needs of the customers.<\/li>\n<li>Identification and development of areas that require revision in case of the current OS and other systems.<\/li>\n<li>The developer will also maintain and suggest several updates that are required for the OS of iPhone and other devices.<\/li>\n<li>Maintenance as well as the testing of the iOS systems and products.<\/li>\n<li>Determining the operation practically and the development of assurance of the procedures.<\/li>\n<li>Developing processes, tools, and metrics for iOS apps.<\/li>\n<li>Coordinating and working with the developers, analysts and business systems.<\/li>\n<li>Creation of diagrams as well as the models which will show the programmers how to develop coding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Differentiating between Junior, Mid-Level, Senior, Guru, and Ninja iOS Developers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The iPhone app development company is always looking for certain specifications for hiring iPhone app developer. The company would hire the developers on the basis of the qualifications that they have.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone app developers are mostly qualified as junior, mid-level, and other senior developers. The differences between these developers are on the basis of the experience, technical knowledge, and the responsibilities that they have.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the differences that are the basis of the classification.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Roles And Responsibility<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Junior iOS Developer<\/h4>\n<p>A junior iPhone app developer is an intern and has about 8-10 months of working experience in total. They have a basic knowledge of the iOS applications and hardware along with software options.<\/p>\n<p>Also, these developers have little knowledge about programming and coding as well. They report to the mid-level iOS developers for the tasks allotted to them.<\/p>\n<p>Their job is to assist the mid-level developers in the projects and handle some small tasks associated with the projects to minimize the risk. Since they are not directly on the projects; there are not many tools which can be used by these developers.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Mid-Level iOS Developer<\/h4>\n<p>Mid-level iOS developers have about 1 and a half or about 2 years of experience and they are the ones that handle the small and insignificant issues that happen in the iOS systems.<\/p>\n<p>So, these developers need to have little knowledge about the internal features and the tools. Tasks related to programming languages are handled by them at a certain level.<\/p>\n<p>A mid-level developer reports to the senior developer for the projects. Their job is to assist senior developers, complete the section of the project and handle the junior developer.<\/p>\n<p>The Mid-Level developers handle about 30% of the project work when it comes to iOS app development.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Senior iOS Developer<\/h4>\n<p>A senior iOS developer is a person that has a work experience of about 2-3 years. Also, a basic knowledge of the programming languages such as C++ is essential for the senior developers. They also need to have experience in handling software problems and issues.<\/p>\n<p>The senior iOS developers would be reporting to the Guru developers in the projects and they handle about 50% of the work.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Guru iOS Developer<\/h4>\n<p>Another one of the most experienced and important categories of iOS developers is the Guru developers. They have the work experience of about 5 years in total. The tasks which are assigned to the Senior and Mid-level developers are decided by the Guru iOS developer.<\/p>\n<p>The Guru developer reports to the Ninja Developers during the project. They handle about 50-60% of the work in any project.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Ninja iOS Developers<\/h4>\n<p>Now, these developers are the ones who have got the most experience in the iOS field. With an experience of about 8-10 years, the Ninja Developers are pros in their field. The Ninja developers are well-versed in the different technologies related to iOS app development and hence all the work is handled by them.<\/p>\n<p>They are masters in the programming languages and the coding. Hence, they have knowledge about other technologies as well. Almost every section of the project can be handled very easily by a ninja developer.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from that, the Ninja developers assign the projects and the tasks to the Guru and Senior developers. They don\u2019t have to report to anyone as they have the highest position.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Salary<\/h3>\n<p>The salary of the different developers depends upon their designation.<br \/>\nAlso, the experience factor has a lot to decide when there is a question of the salary package of these developers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Salary Package Of A Junior Developer: INR 80,000- INR 1, 00,000 P.A.<\/li>\n<li>Salary Package Of A Mid-Level Developer: INR 1, 00,000- INR 2, 00,000 P.A.<\/li>\n<li>Salary Package Of A Senior Developer: INR 2, 00,000- INR 5, 00,000 P.A.<\/li>\n<li>Salary Package Of A Guru Developer: INR 5, 00,000- INR 8, 00,000 P.A<\/li>\n<li>Salary Package Of A Ninja Developer: INR 8, 00,000-INR 12, 00,000 P.A or more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There might be some differences in the salary which depends on the company or the projects that are assigned to the developers.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>So, these were some of the factors that differentiate the various iPhone developers. The value may change according to the budget and requirement of the firm. When hiring for iOS development, every iPhone app development company needs to see these key points in the candidate to lead towards the higher success rate of their projects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the advent of mobile technology, there is an era of mobile devices sweeping all over the planet.
