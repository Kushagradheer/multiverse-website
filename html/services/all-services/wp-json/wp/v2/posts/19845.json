As it is open-source and available under MIT license the developers found it code-friendly framework for mobile app development.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>What is Ionic Framework?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Ionic is an open-source HTML5 based framework for designing hybrid applications. Hybrid apps are rich in Webview which offered many advantages compared to the native applications in terms of speed, coding, testing, and performance criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Ionic apps are well-written in HTML, Javascript, and CSS which helps developer, customer, and owner to feel the UI and UX utmost. This is the reason behind the inception of <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/hire-ionic-developers-to-build-web-and-mobile-apps-using-ionic-4\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Ionic 4 development<\/a>, supported by Angular.<\/p>\n<p>Although, you might agree with my statement that &#8216;the lives of mobile apps is strictly based on its UI&#8217;. Perhaps, Ionic can be considered as an app-friendly UI framework that handles hard of hardest UI interactions of application with the support of native elements and excels design.<\/p>\n<p>When your idea and strategy to deal with the IT apps, then it becomes more important to design, integrate, and deploy the application using the perfect framework.<\/p>\n<p>Considering a new age framework called Ionic supported via Angular leverage you exile benefits.

So, when it comes to the functionality test, the developer will never compromise in that.<\/p>\n<p>The use of AngularJs allows the Ionic developers to provide a robust structure and intuitive interface that makes the code more manageable.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">4. The Winner of Performance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The performance metric of Ionic is magnificent. The native mobile app framework code utilizes in PhoneGap (Apache Cordova) which renders higher-performance compared to hybrid applications. AngularJs accelerate the native hardware performance, GPU level, and maximize available processor time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">5. Utilization of Cordova Plugins<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The Ionic framework utilize the world&#8217;s most rich <a href=\"https:\/\/cordova.apache.org\/plugins\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Cordova Plugin<\/a> in the app&#8217;s inception. The designer and developer can access different components according to the need of time and adjustment.<\/p>\n<p>The Cordova plugins can access features like GPS, Camera, Flashlight, and more where further developers use these features to add in application prototype.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">6. Support C.P<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>At last, the most immersible benefit of using ionic for app development is that it supports cross-platform app development i.e. developer has the option to deploy apps for multiple platforms. Ionic is a complete front-end SDK for <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/cross-platform-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">cross-platform app development<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The information says that Ionic supports Android 4.1 upwards version and iOS 7 along with the support of UWP (Universal Windows Platform).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Summing Up\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>No doubt that Ionic is a deadbolt hybrid app development framework.
