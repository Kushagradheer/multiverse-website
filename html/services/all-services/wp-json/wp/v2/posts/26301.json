There are &#8220;n&#8221; of mobile applications that not only made our tasks easy. but gave a new path to technology enhancement.<\/p>\n<p>Android and iOS are widely used mobile app development platforms used by a large number of people around the globe. Let&#8217;s face it, without these platforms life wouldn&#8217;t be easy going. Don&#8217;t you wonder how these apps are built? The answer has multiple platforms on which applications are developed. The <a href=\"https:\/\/raygun.com\/blog\/native-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">native application frameworks<\/a> started many years back when the application word came into technology.<\/p>\n<p>But the native app framework has a disadvantage. It requires separate coding in both Android and iOS. This leads to an increase in the cost of application and was time-consuming. In comparison to the native app framework, the cross-platform app development framework seems to be widely accepted by the world.<\/p>\n<p>The application platforms widely came into acceptance, people started enhancing the features in it. Developers from the world started developing their frameworks to make mobile application development go smoother. The concept came into existence which partially replaces the native was, Cross-platform mobile app development. The cross-platform technology allows the developer to code once and runs the same code for Android and iOS. Isn&#8217;t it great? It saves the time of the developer and the spending cost of customers.<\/p>\n<p>Cross-platform, in simple terms, a better and more advanced version of native app development that has brought a revolution in the app industry.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/themes\/ninehertz\/images\/cross-platform-infographic.jpg\" alt=\"cross platform apps infographic\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>Embed this infographic on your site<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><textarea style=\"width: 100% !important; height: 155px; background: #fdfdfd none repeat scroll 0 0; border: 1px solid #e5e5e5; border-radius: 2px; color: #888888; padding: 6px 4px; line-height: 2em; resize: none;\" readonly=\"readonly\">&lt;a href=&#8217;https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/everything-about-cross-platform-apps-infographic\/&#8217;&gt;&lt;img src=&#8217;https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/themes\/ninehertz\/images\/cross-platform-infographic.jpg&#8217; alt=&#8217;cross platform apps infographic&#8217; width=&#8217;750px&#8217; height=&#8217;6827px&#8217; border=&#8217;0&#8242; \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;<\/textarea><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What are the Cross-platform App Development Advantages<\/h2>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/ssl.gstatic.com\/trends_nrtr\/2051_RC11\/embed_loader.js\"><\/script> <script type=\"text\/javascript\"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"ionic\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"today 12-m\"},{\"keyword\":\"react native\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"today 12-m\"},{\"keyword\":\"Flutter\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"today 12-m\"},{\"keyword\":\"\/m\/0gtv959\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"today 12-m\"},{\"keyword\":\"\/g\/11bc5kmsh6\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"today 12-m\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"q=ionic,react%20native,Flutter,%2Fm%2F0gtv959,%2Fg%2F11bc5kmsh6&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m\",\"guestPath\":\"https:\/\/trends.google.com:443\/trends\/embed\/\"}); <\/script><\/p>\n<ol style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Code reusability<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Advanced and seamless UI designs<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Cost-effective solutions<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Quick and safe applications<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Increase productivity and saves time<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Easy customization<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: decimal;\">Various options for app development<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Today, there&#8217;s a list of cross-platform frameworks available in the market.
