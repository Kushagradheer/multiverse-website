And it becomes easier for them to develop a user experience that will be fine for all platforms and devices. Including, mobile, smart homes, desktop, embedded device and smart watches.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Flutter 1.12, Dart 2.7, Android 10, &amp; much more!\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lrO16RXdyR4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff;\">Flutter 1.12 Version: What are the Latest Features?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s have a look at what\u2019s new in the Flutter 1.12 and how will it support your decision for <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/cross-platform-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">cross-platform app development<\/a> for your business.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">1.

Still, the Flutter has not been able to prove its worth in the field of game development. Also, with Flutter, you cannot push code directly to the designed application. <\/p>\n<p>But there is a hope that with the passing time, the Flutter development team will resolve all such issues and come up with better options in the Flutter 1.13 versions and above.<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning for flutter app development and want to <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-flutter-developer\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">hire flutter developer<\/a>, you can consider The NineHertz, as we are the leading flutter app development company in India and other countries.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Flutter, an open-source UI framework was introduced by Google back in May 2017.
