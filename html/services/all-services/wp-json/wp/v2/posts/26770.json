Since you have specifically hired the person for the task, why should you be at risk? A freelance app developer does not necessarily stick to your project for the long term, even though it is valuable to you. With full-time jobs, many engineers do project-based work, but if the developer finds another job or project, you might lose a candidate from your team on which you highly relied. <\/p>\n<p>This may result in the failure of your project and may leave you with a major setback. Instead of piling all major work on a single employee, try to distribute the work. Even in the case of absence of one you could make use of the other team members. It&#8217;s much easier to replace a programmer instead of making a project from scratch which may give you monetarily as well time loss. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">In the Nutshell &#8211;<\/h2>\n<p>Team building with expert staff is the most important aspect for any business to scale.
