However, nowadays the sector that\u2019s pulling major attention is the mobile app development whether they are mobile app development companies or businesses that are looking to develop a mobile application for their own. To serve your mobile app development requisites, fortunately, numerous programming tools are available in the industry. However, the one that\u2019s being adopted more and becoming popular than others is the Flutter. If you want to build a Flutter mobile app, you can hire Flutter app developer from top <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/flutter-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Flutter app development<\/a> companies available in India and globally. Let us know about Flutter in detail, kindly have a look.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What is Flutter?<\/h2>\n<p>Flutter is an open-source UI <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_development_kit\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Software Development Kit<\/a> used for cross-platform mobile app development. It means the application developed using this tool is compatible to run on multiple operating systems ranging from Android, iOS to Windows, Mac, Linux, and others.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, Flutter was introduced by Google in 2015 as a beta version. However, with time, Google kept on working on the improvements of Flutter by resolving issues encountered during mobile app development. Finally, in December 2018, Google released its first stable Flutter 1.0 version and since then its gaining popularity in the field of mobile app development.<\/p>\n<p>Lately, in December 2019, the Flutter app development team <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/why-flutter-112-is-the-the-best-google-version-of-the-year-2020\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">released its latest Flutter 1.12 version<\/a>, which is the biggest Google release of the year. The development team reached this stage post resolving around 5,303 issues from the last versions and including 5970 Pull Requests of around 484 contributors across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>With Flutter, you can create beautiful apps with native performances for both the Android and iOS platforms just by writing a single codebase. And Flutter code is written in Dart programming language. Haven\u2019t heard of it, let&#8217;s put some light on the Dart.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What is Dart?<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/01-flutter-dart.jpg\" alt=\"flutter-dart\" \/><br \/>\nGoogle\u2019s creation <a href=\"https:\/\/dart.dev\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dart<\/a> is a programming language. With Dart, you can develop web, mobile apps server, and utilities for IoT devices as well. In the Flutter\u2019s latest 1.12 version, the Dart programming language has been updated from Dart 2.5 to Dart 2.7. The improved Dart offers extra benefits which help in flourishing the mobile apps and IoT devices.  <\/p>\n<p>The codebase written in Dart is compiled using JavaScript. Developers who have hands-on writing code for Java and C# can easily learn Dart and imply it in app development. Because writing code in Dart is quite similar to writing app in Java and C#.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">How Flutter Works?<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/09flutter-works.jpg\" alt=\"flutter-works\" \/><br \/>\nThe app development using Flutter revolves around the combination of widgets. Flutter provides different types of widgets for aspects like structure (a menu or button), styling (a font or color scheme), layout (padding) and others. Using these widgets, you can easily craft the entire UI of the mobile app.<\/p>\n<p>These are Flutter developed widgets and due to it being an open-source platform, any Flutter developer across the world can use these widgets. Also, developers avail the freedom of creating their own widgets.<\/p>\n<p>With other frameworks, you may witness performance issues while compiling programming language to other platforms using JavaScript bridge. However, this is not the issue with Flutter because it comes with reactive-style views and employs Dart for writing apps.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of compiling Dart, it automatically compiles ahead of time (AOT) into the native code for different platforms without using JavaScript bridge. Since it gets compiled to native code ahead of time, the app startup time automatically scaled up to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>For your information, Flutter is the only <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/cross-platform-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">cross-platform mobile app development<\/a> framework that comes with a reactive view without any use of JavaScript. This is the reason which pulls a majority of developers towards cross-platform app development using Flutter. You can hire Flutter app developers to create visually amazing, native performance app for both the platforms.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What are Flutter&#8217;s Key Features?<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/02flutter-Features.jpg\" alt=\"flutter Features\" \/><\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">The initially released version of Flutter, entitled SKY, was compatible only with the Android platform.
