This is usual and being human it&#8217;s natural to forget things unless we put a reminder. There are many apps for such purpose, but the reminder app for calling and messaging is rare and very much useful.<\/p>\n<p>While browsing Play Store I found one such application that works fine and User experience is good, its Free Call &amp; SMS Scheduler Android app. I found it interesting and has following features<\/p>\n<ul class=\"infa_lines\">\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-right\"><\/i>Smart user interface<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-right\"><\/i>Easy to schedule a call or message<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-right\"><\/i>Set speaker and vibration alarm<\/li>\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-right\"><\/i>Nothing to remember once scheduled<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The app is developed by Cubix who has developed many other interesting apps.<\/p>\n<p>Moving further, now what if you misplaced your phone in your house, workplace or forgot after setting it to silent mode below the paper or under the pillow?
