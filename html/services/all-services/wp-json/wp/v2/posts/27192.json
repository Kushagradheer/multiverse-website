Confused to hire React Native app developer? Before you hire, have some knowledge about <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-react-native-developer\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">React Native app development<\/a> trends. Let&#8217;s find out the advantages of React Native.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_technology\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mobile technology<\/a> has grown on a large scale from the last few years. 90%  of the website has been converted into a mobile application. But why are mobile applications so important? Mobile nowadays is considered as a basic need of the generation. The application plays a vital role in the importance of mobile phones in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>There are millions of mobile applications available on Google and Apple app stores. How do we choose which mobile application is best for us? It depends on our use, but the major things which we see before choosing any application are the designs, performance, high-security and all such factors.  <\/p>\n<p>Mobile applications started with a single technology, i.e., Native app development which allowed developers to develop an application for different platforms. For example, if any business owner wants to create an app for his business. Then he has to hire two different developers to create Android and iOS applications. Hiring two developers increases the cost and a business owner might not find it profitable. A solution to all of these problems arrived when cross-platform was introduced to the developers and it took the mobile development technology to the whole new next level.<\/p>\n<p>React Native is one of the best <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/the-new-era-of-app-development-using-react-native\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">cross-platform app development technology<\/a> used by a wide range of developers around the globe.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What are the Benefits of React Native App Development?<\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Community Expertise<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/reactnative.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Native<\/a> is a free and open-source platform in which every developer can share the portfolio and ideas which are available to all the community members around the globe. This community-driven technology is beneficial as it gives the developers a wide range of ideas to write the code. It is also known as the King of Social Media and is introduced by Facebook. React Native community as it allows developers to ask their questions and discuss freely with the experts of the community.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Code Re-usability<\/h3>\n<p>Code in React Native can be reused, i.e. developers do not have to write code for each platform. Like this, it saves time and cost which makes it more unique. The <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/10-takeaways-developers-to-consider-while-react-native-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">best thing about the React Native<\/a> is that the same code can be reused for web applications as well. Using React Native lessens up the development time and speeds up the app launch. Since React Native is an open-source library, codes can be reused and implement it according to the app requirement.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Live Reloading and Hot Reloading<\/h3>\n<p>This feature in React Native compiles and reads the file where changes are made. It allows automatic reading from the applications at the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/reactnative.dev\/blog\/2016\/03\/24\/introducing-hot-reloading.html\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hot reloading feature<\/a> allows safeguarding the updated file while the app is running the application. There is a minute difference between these two features that come when saving the changes. In hot reloading, it is easy to modify the code and therefore developers don&#8217;t need app recompilation of reviewing the code.<\/p>\n<p>The outcome of the <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">mobile app development<\/a> is shown instantly after making the changes. It also reduces the waiting time to see the changes.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">React Native Cost-effective<\/h3>\n<p>Since it is a single codebase, i.e. one code can be reused for platforms. It saves a lot of time as the business owner doesn&#8217;t need to hire android and iOS developers separately to make their application. Hire React developer and make your application on Android and iOS at less cost.<br \/>\nIt is obvious hiring two developers is way more costly than hiring a single developer. Using React we can not only get multiple features but also saves our time and money.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Supports the Plug-ins<\/h3>\n<p>React Native supports the third-party plugins as it includes native modules and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.javascript.com\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript<\/a> modules in its package. Maximum number third party plugins can be used in your application without any hassle. Now the user has a wide range of options available to make its app or user-friendly and feature-rich.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Offers Stability<\/h3>\n<p>The React Native is known for its process of data binding. This makes the application mo more and increases the reliability of the application. It only provides updating of specific components and if needed any modification changes are made first and then the updating process takes place.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Wide Range of UI<\/h3>\n<p>Since React Native is a free and open-source cross-platform app development framework. Developers from all over the world share their designs and code in the community. It can be reused and customized by anybody. Likewise, developers enhance the designing skills and make your designs unimaginable and perfect for business. The users have several options for UI designs.

It can be used to create an app for platforms such as android, iOS, and windows. It is a JavaScript-based framework.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Do React Native take time for development?<\/h3>\n<p>It works to write once and runs everywhere, which means code is written once and ruins on multiple platforms. It takes 50-65% less time than Native to develop an application.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Is it expensive to build an app to React Native to my business?<\/h3>\n<p>React Native is beneficial for you if you want to make your application both android and iOS. For application development, you don&#8217;t need to hire android and iOS developers separately. Instead, just hire React Native developers and let him make an app for both the platforms.
