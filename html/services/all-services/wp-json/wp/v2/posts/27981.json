For all of these questions, there\u2019s one solution, i.e. cross-platform application development services. How does it save money? How does it benefit you? Let\u2019s find out with this complete guide of 2020 showing the advancements of cross-platform mobile app development.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cross-platform is among those platforms which have made mobile application development easy and highly used among the coders.<\/p>\n<p>In the modern era, the lives of people have been surrounded by mobile phones. This gadget is no longer used to make calls and texts. Moreover, it has its importance in the daily activity of humans. From a small reminder to booking flight tickets, the mobiles played a crucial role. That is the reason this 6-inch screen is considered as a basic need of the 21st century. But what made it so important to us? Well, the various applications in the mobile which do their respective work to make our lives easygoing. With the various applications, the various platforms are introduced for mobile phones such as Windows, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The world is divided into these platforms using their compatible application. Whenever a businessman thinks to deploy its business online, he tries to gain the attention of almost every user. The application owner plans the idea of the targeted audience and makes sure he spends less money on building it and captures more attention from users.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, a businessman needs to build an application separately on each platform to get the overall audience. This may increase the cost of building and sometimes it may be a hassle for the coders to implement the same functionality and feature in different platforms. the technology has waived its magic wand and introduced a platform that has solved this problem. One can now create the code once and runs it on different platforms. This kind of multiplatform or independent platform development. It is named as cross-platform development. Is it worth using? Let&#8217;s find out its pros and cons!<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"What is Cross Platform Development? - Mobile and Desktop Explained\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TWFUSxqMJic?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Which is Better?

But which technology has performed well and is loved worldwide. Developers around the world always develop something new which replaces the previous technology or has a better version of it.<\/p>\n<p>Native is specifically made for a single platform that allows developers to develop only for a single platform. For eg: Android accepts java, Apple accepts Objective C and swift. These separations of platforms and technology help the developers to build any app with a wide range of compatible options. Whereas cross-platform has merged both Android and iOS and works on HTML and CSS, It allows the developer to create a single code for multiple platforms. These were the basic introduction of both technologies. Now, let&#8217;s find out whether the native is better or cross-platform has higher users.<\/p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>FACTORS<\/th>\n<th>NATIVE PLATFORM<\/th>\n<th>CROSS-PLATFORM<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deployment cost for multiple platforms<\/td>\n<td>Deployment cost higher as app architecture adoption is different<\/td>\n<td>Cross platform requires little cost to deploy as code is the same and no architecture needed<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time of development<\/td>\n<td>It takes longer time as code written from scratch for each platform<\/td>\n<td>Cross platform allows code to be written once and run on multiple platforms<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audience reach<\/td>\n<td>Developing an app in single platform may lose 50% users of other platforms<\/td>\n<td>It allows app to run for multiple platforms to reach wider range of users<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Designing techniques<\/td>\n<td>Designs are simplified and support is given by the respective operating system<\/td>\n<td>In Cross-platform, developers add some additional features<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost for hiring developers<\/td>\n<td>Native developers cost high as they have expertise in single platform<\/td>\n<td>Cross platforms are easier to find and hiring them is pocket-friendly<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>&nbsp;<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/everything-about-cross-platform-apps-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Everything About Cross-Platform Apps \u2013 Infographic<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Pros And Cons Of Cross-Platform Mobile App Development<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Inner-Pros-and-cons-of-cross-platform.jpg\" alt=\"Pros-and-cons-of-cross-platform\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Every coin has two sides and so with the technology.

The cross-platform has gained popularity in less time. What is the cost of developing an application in cross platform technology? To all answer all your cost-related questions, let\u2019s read further. Prior to building a cross-platform app, developers need to prepare a budget of its estimated cost. This can be done by considering the factors mentioned below:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Firstly, you need to consider the amount of research as the ultimate success of the app depends wholly on the same. However, good research doesn\u2019t always mean more cost. Rather it depends on the data collection methods and type of research conducted. Herein it is imperative to note that primary data collection is comparatively more expensive than secondary data collection. However, the reliability of primary data is more.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">The human resource employed can also determine the cross-platform app development to a great extent. Skilled labour is expensive but at the same time, it can guarantee better results. While in-house developers are affordable, offshore ones come with an expensive tag. It is always best to opt for a mix of both.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Next comes the requirement of regular maintenance and routine updates. Usually, the project size and maintenance size go hand in hand.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Testing also has a big role to play in determining the cross-platform app development cost. It becomes essential to conduct thorough testing prior to launching the app for public use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Scope of Cross-Platform Mobile Development<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Inner-Future-of-Cross-platform-App-Development.jpg\" alt=\"Future-of-Cross-platform-App-Development\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Previously developers used to undertake native app -development which could cater only to a specific set of audience. But cross-platform app development has brought significant changes in this field. Developers can now bring along massive time savings and redirect the same towards further development as the cross-platform apps can cater to a wider user base at once. You can take the example of the Flutter by Google, which has gained massive popularity off late. So, read to know more about how Flutter is playing the role of a torchbearer in the field of cross-platform app development:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">This cross-platform technology helps in obtaining native-performing apps and develops it using the built-in components.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Users can get ready access to their resources with a large number of packages and plug-ins available over Flutter.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">A single code base makes it redundant to use an additional JavaScript badge. This, in turn, makes Flutter very simple in operation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The cross-platform applications can easily remove the disparity between OS platforms which arises in its UI and UX. This also reduces the budget which developers have to allocate in app development. As a result, the applications can cater to the requirement of more users on the lookout for affordable solutions.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Final Words<\/h2>\n<p>Cross-platform mobile application development has gained popularity in past years because of its single codebase feature. It has saved 80% of the cost of hiring developers as cross-platform developers can build applications for both Android and iOS. The development time has also lessened due to the WORA model (Write Once Run Anywhere). The platform has given options to the user for different businesses to make any type of application in no downtime. Better user-interface, quick loading time, and easy customization have made the rank of cross-platform technology higher than any other technology. The time will show what replaces this advanced technology or how much this technology evolutes in the coming years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Are you looking for budget-friendly mobile applications?
