In wake of integration of additional features, one can ask for a contact form, a subscription button, a CTA button, a new template design and much more.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square; margin-bottom: 2%;\"><b>Medium web projects:<\/b> several types of projects fall in this category. It could be the development of static and dynamic web apps, online stores and others which require third-party integration likewise APIs, chatbots, databases, CRM, CMS and others.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square; margin-bottom: 2%;\"><b>Large-scale projects:<\/b> as the name refers, these projects require sophisticated technologies and huge databases (cloud web hosting services) to store data of all the users. The development of a video sharing social media app or social networks is part of the large-scale projects category.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other than this, there could be other projects based on these following three cases. <\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square; margin-bottom: 2%;\">Build a project from scratch. In this case, customers who are willing to hire a website developer could be existing businesses or star-ups. The existing businesses could look for automation of some business process, either adopting in-house or a dedicated web development team. While the reason behind choosing a web development team from start-ups may be the eagerness to enter their niche as soon as possible without wasting time and money.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square; margin-bottom: 2%;\">Looking for expansion of your in-house team with the integration of an extra specialist for the ongoing project. You can fulfil this requirement by hiring a free web developer, or outsourcing a developer from a web development agency for a particular time.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square; margin-bottom: 2%;\">Contemplating over using a new technology of which nobody has experience of working on it within your in-house dev team. In such a scenario, either you would wait for the developers to learn the technology or go for hiring a web developer from an outsourcing agency who has hands-on said technology.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Choose for Web Developer According to Your Project Need<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/full-stack-development.gif\" alt=\"full-stack-development\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the web development sector, there are three types of developers available in the market. Back-end, front-end and full-stack developers. Let\u2019s start with <\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px; color: #3366ff;\">Back-end Developers<\/h3>\n<p>The developers who handle the working of the website through website structure, behind the front-end are known as Back-end developers. They help in improving the speed of the website, resolve technical issues and perform third party services integration duties into the web architecture. Back-end developers mostly use technologies like PHP, Java, Python and Ruby while they prefer to choose databases from SQL-MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB and others.  <\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px; color: #3366ff;\">Front-end Developers<\/h3>\n<p>Front-end developers create the user-interface of the website where users interact with your business. You can hire a front-end developer for tasks like reviving the design or layout of the website. But you must understand the difference between a front-end developer and web designer. Web designer\u2019s work is targeted to user experience. They create the website layout, colour scheme and other visual elements for offering amazing user experience. Whereas, the front end developers offer functionality to the website using technologies PHP, ASP.NET, Angular8, React.JS, Vue, HTML, CSS, Javascript and others.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px; color: #3366ff;\">Full-stack Developers<\/h3>\n<p>Full-stack developers are those individuals who have experience of working on both the platforms, the front-end and back-end of the website. This quality of these individuals makes them highly preferable among start-ups companies. Because they have limited resources and choosing separate developers costs heavier as compared to hiring a single full stack developer. <\/p>\n<p>After a clear interpretation of developers here, it\u2019s time to choose the right developer according to your project.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Where to Find Skilled Web Developers?<\/h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Web Development Project Ideas for Beginners | Building beginner projects in Javascript\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/97WtfXyjtRo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, it is easier to find the best developers according to your web project requirements.

One of the most important qualities to look for before hiring a web developer. Because programming offers different ways to reach out to your end goal. Other than finding or creating solutions for the occurred issues so that the website can perform seamlessly.

Before hiring them you need to consider a few more things other than above-mentioned characteristics of a web developer. <\/p>\n<p>Since working remotely is completely different from working inside a company office. So the qualities and characteristics of a good remote developer will also differ from an in-house developer.<\/p>\n<p><b>In-house developers<\/b> work under the circumstances where they are surrounded by other employees and have leaders or executives. Who timely checks out their work and motivates them to attain their set goals through meetings and casual conversations throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, web developers who work remotely remain in the lonely and monotonous environment that turns out to be mentally draining for them. They are required to have the following characteristics in top priority over general qualities of in-house developers. So that they can work successfully and maintain productivity to deliver high-quality work regularly. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Fill-form-to-request-a-quote.jpg\" alt=\"request-a-quote\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Self-motivated<\/b><br \/>\nWeb developers who work remotely should be self-motivated since they have to work for hours without any outside motivation. The benefit in-house developers enjoy from the presence of employees in their surroundings other than the leader or executives who take care of the work progress towards set goals. Self-motivation will let them work efficiently and deliver high-quality work within the given deadline. <\/p>\n<p><b>Self-critical<\/b><br \/>\nThe remote developers should be constructively self-critical so that they can produce high-quality work every time. Since in the absence of a manager and founder who remains responsible to influence and criticize the work of in-house developers. There are high chances, remote developers may end up performing inadequate work.<\/p>\n<p><b>Initiatives<\/b><br \/>\nInitiatives are essential in development work whether performed remotely or in-house. In the case of remote developers, they must have the initiative ability. Since with in-house development, they always have a manager or team leader who keeps on prompting and encouraging their developers to seek out and address problems. <\/p>\n<p>These are the qualities that a remote developer not only possess in abundance but also have developed and demonstrated throughout its career.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What is the Web Development Cost?<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/web-design-cost.jpg\" alt=\"web-design-cost\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is not easy to estimate the budget of a web project since it involves several variables that need to be considered. Likewise speed, quality of code, the scope of work and others. <\/p>\n<p>Generally, a golden rule of choosing two out of speed, quality, cheap price is highly popular and used mostly in outsourced projects. It applies for web development agency as well. <\/p>\n<p>Besides this, budgeting of a web project can also be estimated by knowing exactly what you will get for a set price, or you can ask your developers estimated hours to complete the project if they charge on an hourly basis. <\/p>\n<p>However, it is not that easy for most of the developers to give you an exact hours estimate at the beginning of the project due to the way the development works. Instead, you can contact developers at each stage of the project to know they are on time or require more hours to complete the project.  <\/p>\n<p>Also, the skills and programming languages you are going to adopt influence the cost of the project along with the developers\u2019 location.<\/p>\n<p>So if you are on a tight budget and don&#8217;t want to exceed the cost of your project, it is better to go with a set price. However, it is a bitter truth that not every developer likes to work this way but being clear just from the beginning will help you in the long run.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/linkedin-web-dev-cost.jpg\" alt=\"linkedin-web-dev-cost\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><i>Source: LinkedIn Pulse<\/i><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Opt for Hiring Model<\/h2>\n<p>There are three types of popular working models you can choose from according to your project requirements. <\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\">The Project-based Model<\/h3>\n<p>The model is majorly selected by the start-ups or well-established businesses that want to complete a small web development project.

Whereas the web development team handles the project management and the choice of technological solutions here. Ultimately, the web development team remains responsible for all activities in this business model. <\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\">A Dedicated Team Business Model<\/h3>\n<p>The model works better if you want to implement complex functions to your website without wasting time and money on hiring-in house specialists. Likewise the integration of cloud storage, or AI Chatbot development. In this business model, either you can control the project roadmap or handover the responsibilities to your dedicated web development team. Here, the party which handles the project management process remains responsible for the success of the project. If the PM is from the customer side, they will handle the development team. <\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size:17px;\">Out Staff or Extended Team Model<\/h3>\n<p>The business model is best suited if you are planning to work on a big project without exceeding your budget. However, you will be required to have an in-house CTO and project manager to handle responsibilities like assigning tasks to the extended team, monitoring progress management and leading web developers on the technical front. This working model provides customers with all the responsibilities, validation and control.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"How to Hire a Developer - How to find a developer\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5lGbU-dYNPs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">Select a Payment Model<\/h2>\n<p>After deciding you want to work with a single web developer or web development team, you will be required to make payment for these individuals every month like regular workers.
