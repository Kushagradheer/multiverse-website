As the technology matured and a variety of blockchains bloomed, the uses quickly diverged from the pure money aspect. Instead, technologists experimented with ideas like a decentralized name registry. Other uses utilized the peer-to-peer aspect to deliver messages in a discrete way. In the end, many of these projects failed to find good use of technology. The projects left standing helped demonstrate what was possible beyond buzzwords.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SSo_EIwHSd4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that forms a \u201cchain of blocks.\u201d Each block includes information and data that are bundled together and verified. These blocks are then validated and strung onto the chain of transactions and information in previous blocks. These blocks of transactions are permanently recorded in the distributed ledger that is the blockchain. Learn more about blockchain technology here.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Cryptocurrency As An Asset Class<\/h3>\n<p>Contrasted with blockchain, cryptocurrency has to do with the use of tokens based on the distributed ledger technology. Cryptocurrency can be seen as a tool or resource on a blockchain network. Anything dealing with buying, selling, investing, trading, microtipping, or other monetary aspects deals with a blockchain native token or subtoken.<\/p>\n<p>It is a token based on the distributed ledger that is a blockchain. Cryptocurrency is a <span style=\"color: #3366ff\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_currency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital currency<\/a><\/span> formed on the basis of cryptography, or by definition, \u201cthe art of solving or writing codes.\u201d Although all are considered cryptocurrencies, these tokens can serve different purposes on these networks.<\/p>\n<p>Referring to the token as the technology can be right in the case of Bitcoin, but is very different when dealing with other blockchain projects like Ethereum. In this case, the technology is known as Ethereum, but the native token is Ether, and transactions are paid in gas.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin<\/h3>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30379\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bitcoin-Cash.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoin cash\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bitcoin-Cash.jpg 750w, https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bitcoin-Cash-300x132.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash derive their value from how much they are adopted, used and demanded. We can analyze them in terms of ROI (return on investment) and value growth.<\/p>\n<p>They are both holders of value, and while Bitcoin has been the holder of the most value up until now, Bitcoin Cash is gaining users and value fast.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash is still less than a year old. So, it is still in the stage of capturing and realizing its own place in the crypto market. Many people speculate that Bitcoin Cash might take a good portion of Bitcoin\u2019s market share, making it the new dominant crypto in the industry. This is because Bitcoin Cash has addressed the scaling issues that Bitcoin faces, allowing more people to use it with ease and lower fees.<\/p>\n<p>If the Bitcoin developer community doesn\u2019t find a way to agree to a mutual update to the Bitcoin code to fix its problems, Bitcoin might lose in the war between BTC vs BCH. This means that more people will likely switch to using BCH as their main store of value and transactional currency.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Hyperledger vs Ethereum<\/h3>\n<p>The most essential distinction between Hyperledger and Ethereum is the intent they are designed for.<\/p>\n<p>Ethereum runs the Smart Contracts on the EVM for applications that are attributed to being decentralized and are for mass consumption.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/contact-us\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30381\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Hire-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-developer.jpg\" alt=\"hire cryptocurrency exchange developer\" width=\"750\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Hire-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-developer.jpg 750w, https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Hire-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-developer-300x68.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Hyperledger leverages blockchain technology for business. It is designed to support pluggable implementations of components delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resilience and scalability. Hyperledger has a modular architecture and provides a lot of flexibility in how you want to use it. Its extensible architecture provides futuristic solutions for enterprise blockchains.<\/p>\n<p>Through Hyperledger, it is possible for Andy to sell pies to Bobby at a discounted price while keeping their agreement confidential from Andy\u2019s other customers.<\/p>\n<p>Such an arrangement would not be possible if Andy was using Ethereum for the same. Because Ethereum is absolutely transparent and every transaction is visible to everyone on the network.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, Hyperledger allows confidential transactions. Consequently, it gives businesses the flexibility and security to make transactions visible to select parties having correct encryption keys.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cryptocurrency is an internet-based, i.e. a digital currency which uses cryptographic functions to conduct the transactions.
