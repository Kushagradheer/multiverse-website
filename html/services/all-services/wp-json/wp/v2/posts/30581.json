The cross-platform app development with Flutter requires limited time and resources while returning a huge revenue in the long term. In this article, we are going to have an in-depth discussion about the Flutter and reasons why it is a development trend in 2020?<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Introducing Flutter\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fq4N0hgOWzU?start=30&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff;\">What is Flutter?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/flutter.dev\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flutter<\/a> is an open-source platform that provides a complete Software Development Kit (SDK) including tools required for cross-platform mobile app development. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_development_kit\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SDK kit<\/a> comprises ready to use widgets, engine rendering, command-line tools, APIs for testing and integration. It uses a single codebase for the development of native-like iOS and Android apps.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, the Flutter strategy of working on a reactive development architecture lets automatically adjust UI contents whenever the developer modifies the variables. React Native also works on this policy. However, it does require a JavaScript bridge to maintain OEM widgets. In this scenario, there is a vast possibility of occurring performance issues. But with Flutter, you won&#8217;t end up meeting such issues since it has eliminated the bridge concept and its combination with the app completely.<\/p>\n<p>Flutter works on OOPs concept which helps in an easy compilation of written code into native code without any requirement of extra bridges. Not even this, it helps in accelerating start-up time of an application to a great extent.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>&nbsp;<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/flutter-guide-101-future-of-cross-platform-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Flutter Guide 101: What is the Future of Flutter App Development?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff;\">Key Features of Flutter App Development<\/h2>\n<p>After knowing the basics of the Flutter, let\u2019s focus on some of its key features increasing not only its popularity but also <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/guide-to-cross-platform-app-development-in-2020\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">demand for cross-platform app development<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Flutter facilitates the development of applications for different platforms like Android and iOS, using just a single codebase.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Flutter&#8217;s hot reload feature enables developers with numerous widget options and lets them function in a dynamic interface.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">Flutter uses a command named Flutter Doctor.

It offers a cloud computing solution to work on the development of comprehensive native applications. Using Flutter one can build applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single code environment.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are other options available in the market for native app development like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.java.com\/en\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Java<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/kotlinlang.org\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kotlin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/swift\/\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swift<\/a>. But Flutter is gaining popularity due to its enhanced user experience as promised by Google.<\/p>\n<p>Higher the demand for Flutter app development will increase the number of Flutter mobile app developers, directly proportional to the relationship. Since last year, we are noticing a rise in the Flutter developers community, with the emergence of new Flutter programmers, learning the language and willing to contribute to the growth of the community.<\/p>\n<p>They are having documented sources and different QA forums to learn from the experience of the best Flutter developers.<\/p>\n<p>Not even this, the Stack Overflow Graph also demonstrates a clear rise in <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/ask-me-anything-about-react-native-flutter-ionic-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flutter Development Services as compared to React Native or Ionic<\/a>. And the credit goes to the support provided by Google. In fact, the giant has developed a technology, Flutter that is wholeheartedly accepted not only by the developers but also by the companies. That\u2019s how it\u2019s a win-win solution for everyone.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">B) Develop Fast and High Performing Apps<\/h3>\n<p>If any developer is willing to learn a new language, he might face a lot of challenges. It could be issues related to the lack of standardization and features which makes the language less popular.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is not the case with the Flutter. Since it uses <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dart_(programming_language)\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dart as its programming language<\/a>. The language meant for offering higher optimization of the user interface.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, using Dart programmers can create application architecture with standardization, write code and maintain it easily since the language uses a simple and clean syntax which makes it a powerful tool.<\/p>\n<p>If it is compared with the C# and TypeScript, the syntax type is quite similar, which ends up the need of learning something new to the developers. They are required to expand their existing knowledge while working on the Dart language.<\/p>\n<p>For any other help, there is a rising developer\u2019s community and documentation to resolve issues and keep on moving to work on Dart language.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/contact-us\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/request-a-quote-for-flutter-app-development.jpg\" alt=\"request-a-quote-for-flutter-app-development\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Important Facts Need to Know About Flutter<\/h3>\n<p>Based on graphics and rendering engines built-in C\/C++, Flutter apps are classified into native binaries. Consequently, it became easier to develop fast and high-performance apps.<\/p>\n<p>On the performance front, Flutter apps provide the steady speed of 60fps on most of the devices whereas on the ones which support the applications it reaches an incredible speed of 120 fps.<\/p>\n<p>The characteristics like high-performance compilation and different code efficiency factors of the Flutter developer community stand it strong and prominent in the field of mobile app development.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">C) The Best Possible Platform of MVP<\/h3>\n<p>MVP or Minimal Viable Product, one of the best ways to validate your business idea. Using this approach, you can receive feedback from the customers and make changes accordingly. It reduces the possibilities of failures to a great extent.<\/p>\n<p>Flutter app development is all about getting more from limited resources whether time or money. It benefits cross-platform app development which means developing apps for one platform and it will be compatible with different platforms like web, desktop, and mobile.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/flutter-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Flutter app development services<\/a> allows the development of applications and its release across the platform on the scheduled date in a single go.<\/p>\n<p>Flutter offers high speed, ease of integration and flexibility of the user interface. Due to flexible UI, the technology comes up as the best option to create a mobile MVP.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, you can have an edge over the competitors by releasing Flutter apps on multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<p>MVPs are valuable for a business when it comes to time and cost since it provides an estimate required to spend on the project.<\/p>\n<p>With Flutter, you can develop apps with minimum features and be able to work on different platforms. For such applications, MVP or Minimum Viable Product is the better option to validate what you want from the business application.<\/p>\n<p>To work on your project, you can hire the best Flutter developer from an offshore company. He will suggest the best possible solution in your budget.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, Flutter apps are always high performing. Thanks to a diverse range of available plug-ins and widgets, which lets the consumers enjoy the high-end experience.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">Why is the Flutter Development Trending in 2020?<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Flutter-Development-Trending-in-2020.jpg\" alt=\"Flutter-Development-Trending-in-2020\" \/><\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Single Codebase System<\/h3>\n<p>Flutter SDK allows the development of applications for mobile, web and desktop using a single codebase. These apps are prone to run on both the Android and iOS platforms.<\/p><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Saves Time<\/h3>\n<p>The Hot Reload feature of the technology simplifies app deployment without wasting any time as compared to regular programming. With Flutter, it is easier to apply all the changes instantly to the application without losing its current state. One can fix bugs, build UI and add new features without compromising on speed and development of the application.<\/p><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Same UI and Business Logic in all Platforms<\/h3>\n<p>Flutter which uses reusable widgets for app UI creation has common patterns. Due to this, there is no need for individually adjusting the UI properties like colour, styling, etc. The UI and business logic can be adjusted globally by making changes to the code for both the iOS and Android platforms.<\/p><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Hot Reload Feature Cooperation for Developer and Designer<\/h3>\n<p>Flutter\u2019s hot reload that provides an instant rendering of changes made to the code. Offers cooperation for both the developer and the designer. If the developer suggests any change to UI, the designer will be able to notice it and act accordingly. That\u2019s how both can get satisfied with the changes made.<\/p><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Similar to Native App Performance<\/h3>\n<p>Flutter apps which are written in Dart language do not use JavaScript bridges to compile code to native machine code. This accelerates the process of compiling and releasing apps way faster than any other app development platform.<\/p><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">High App Responsiveness<\/h3>\n<p>Flutter apps can operate on any platform without any modification required to its Dart code. The scope of flutter app development has already extended from mobile apps to web and desktop apps, which are inactive use today.<\/p><\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Requires Less Testing<\/h3>\n<p>Since Flutter uses a single codebase to deploy applications on different platforms. Therefore, developers are required to test applications just for once. This reduces the time for testing and application\u2019s marketing as well.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe title=\"Why Choose Flutter?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/L2OsgmirBwo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">What are the Expectations of Flutter App Development?<\/h2>\n<p>The Flutter\u2019s popularity is growing day by day with its increased use for mobile app development. <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/what-makes-flutter-ideal-for-cross-platform-app-development\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Flutter is preferred over other cross-platform app development platforms<\/a>.
