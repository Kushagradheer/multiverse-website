The data here is chronologically stored in blocks. Once any transaction or data exchange takes place in a blockchain network, everyone will have a record or copy of this action on their own devices.<\/p>\n<p>These data blocks are associated with a chain and once they are linked to the chain, no one can make changes to it. That is why a blockchain is extremely volatile and hard to steal data from it. <\/p>\n<p>Setting up a blockchain requires enough storage space (from a few gigabytes to a terabyte). So one can\u2019t develop a blockchain in a mobile device since it does not contain that much storage space. <\/p>\n<p>Blockchain can be classified into two types based on the type of network.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"What is blockchain and how can it change our society? | Ali Raza Dar | TEDxFHNW\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kvyKyRZJYh0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">#1 Permissionless Blockchain<\/h3>\n<p>It is a kind of blockchain that is accessible to all the members of the network and available to their own devices. Every member in the network has the right to access the code, verify transactions and interact with others while keeping their identity unknown. Bitcoin is the perfect example of permissionless blockchain. <\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px;\">#2 Permissioned Blockchain<\/h3>\n<p>A blockchain that allows only authorized users known as permissioned blockchain. In this blockchain network, every member has their roles and permissions. Not even this, this blockchain is regulated by a definite set of rules for transactions between the network members. The adoption of this kind of blockchain can be witnessed majorly for managing operations within organizations. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0; color: #3366ff;\">What are the Benefits of Blockchain Apps?<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Key-Benefits-of-Blockchain-Technology-in-Trade-Finance.jpg\" alt=\"Key-Benefits-of-Blockchain-Technology-in-Trade-Finance\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Blockchain apps are gaining popularity since they offer an anonymous and secure platform. Other than this, there is much more that encourages businesses towards the adoption of blockchain technology. <\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">\n<li style=\"list-style: square;\"><b>Public Verification:<\/b> Peer users of a blockchain who are also known as verifiers, confirm each transaction.
