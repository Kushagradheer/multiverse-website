But here we are considering the most essential of them such as platform, design, application features and development team. Let\u2019s shed some light on the mentioned factors and know how they affect the final cost of app development like TikTok.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Platforms<\/h3>\n<p>No matters what kind of application you are going to develop, it\u2019s significant to decide on the platform you are going to target for that particular application- iOS or Android. But for the app like TikTok, it\u2019s better to target both the platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Since TikTok stats suggest more than 53.3 % users on smartphones (iOS+Android). So considering cross-platform app development over native app development is way worthy. It allows application access over different platforms like iOS, Android and Windows using a single code base. For cross-platform, you can adopt any of these modern technologies like React, Flutter, Vue, Angular and more. There are several prominent <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">mobile app development<\/span><\/a> companies which provide cross-platform app development. You can hire a budget-friendly partner according to your project requirement.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are short in budget developing the application for a single platform considering your target audience is the best choice ever. For example, Instagram initially launched the application for the iOS platform whereas its Android version made its way to the app market one year after the launch of the iOS version.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">UI\/UX Design<\/h3>\n<p>App design is one of the key factors that ensure the success of an application. It played a vital role in making TikTok a huge success. The application\u2019s user-friendly and intuitive UI\/UX design not only helps in pulling a large number of new users but also builds trust and loyalty among them towards the application.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Features<\/h3>\n<p>That many and unique features your application will have, its cost will automatically rise in proportion. So it is important to make a list of features before starting the development of an app like TikTok. In case you are going to add advanced features to the application, it will affect the pricing since developers require more time for such development of features.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">Development Team<\/h3>\n<p>Last but not the least, this factor has a great impact on deciding the final cost of your app development. To make an app like TikTok, you can outsource projects to a mobile app development company with <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/hire-dedicated-developers\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">best mobile app developers<\/span><\/a> (top iOS app developer or Android app developers) or hire in-house developers. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages.<\/p>\n<p>Hiring an in-house team of developers will cost you more. You have to spend on hardware and software purchases, licence fees, taxes, recruitment expenses and more. However, there will be communication ease regarding development strategies and resolving issues that occurred during the time of development.<\/p>\n<p>However, in case you outsourced the project with a team of developers. The costing will be estimated based on hourly rates and location of the developers. The developers from Eastern Europe are highly qualified yet ask for low hourly rates.<\/p>\n<p>Here you can find the hourly rate list of developers as per their location.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>\u00a0<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/how-much-does-it-cost-for-a-grocery-app-like-big-basket-and-instacart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">How Much Does it Cost for a Grocery App like BigBasket and InstaCart?<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">8.
