The Right Feature Set<\/h3>\n<p>Using the iBeacon app, one can approximate the physical distance between a user and a broadcasting beacon. Now you can share information with the user based on his\/her behavioural history in context with the beacon. But to do so, mapping between the beacon and the user is must. Once the mapping is done, the backend of the application starts aggregating the vital information of the user like his\/her exact location, time spent and application context. This information will tell you more about the interest of the user so that you can push time-based coupons to that particular beacon\u2019s location and user\u2019s preferences. So these are the factors which are must to keep in mind along with the following aspects while selecting a feature set for iBeacon app.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">Include elements which help in enhancing user\u2019s experience.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">Ensure user privacy<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">Include features that do not cripple the app if the beacon is out of range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">2. The Permission Matrix<\/h3>\n<p>If a user wants to use features associated with a Beacon, he\/she is required to grant location permissions. Along with it, the bluetooth of the device must be turned on. Other than this, there are several parameters which must be fulfilled in order to offer a seamless performance between the app and the beacons. Since these parameters form the permission matrix and it is essential that these parameters should be met in a permission matrix for a proper functioning of a beacon app. Which are:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 5%\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">The device should have <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bluetooth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">bluetooth<\/span><\/a> specification in order to support beacons.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">Bluetooth should be turned on so that the device can easily interact with the beacons.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">Location services should be enabled.<\/li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square;\">The app should have authorization to access the device\u2019s location.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Beacon-enabled applications require permission to access bluetooth and location services, if they are looking to interact with beacons. One can make users enable these services through push-notification when the user is in the range of beacons. But for a new application, the best way to ask for permission access is in the end when the user gets aware of almost all the feautres and is in the range of beacons.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">3. Triangulation and Tracking<\/h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>\u00a0<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/adding-ibeacon-to-your-mobile-strategy-how-effective-will-that-be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">Adding iBeacon to Your Mobile Strategy \u2013 How Effective Will That Be?<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Since iBeacon offers a one way radio communication therefore there is no choice of developing a two-way communication between the beacon and the application. Due to this reason, beacons that broadcast cannot recognize the users\u2019 devices. Only the advanced iBeacon offers the facility of two-way communication, they can establish connection with the mobile devices and transmit data back to the server. Besides all, this is not the part of iBeacon specifications, so it will drain your device battery significantly.<\/p>\n<p>So the best way is to let the app work itself. It will allow you to connect with the backend and update data with the registered users and personalize the app accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">4. Problems with Hardware and Signals<\/h3>\n<p>iBeacons work on the Bluetooth low energy technology. So it is necessary that the application should take care of external signals interactions. Because, the frequency of bluetooth low energy and the Wi-Fi interface falls in the similar spectrum band. It can be a problem for the iBeacon to find the user device.<\/p>\n<p>The beacon signals\u2019 quality may vary considering factors like temperature, device power and others. In other words, we can say the accuracy of signals among different iBeacon hardware manufacturers and the app may vary according to the type and variable information received by them.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"iBeacons Explained: 10 Things About iBeacons You Need to Know | Pulsate Academy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/L44m7otNI7o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">5. The Server Piece<\/h3>\n<p>An iBeacon app uses a range of variables which requires different business logic scripts as essential for extracting out data accrodingly. Whenever an application reaches in the range of a beacon, it starts accessing the business logic script and gets a list of users registered at that beacon. Not only, the scripts provide filtered information but also try to interpret the meaning of the information. In certain scenarios like when the device drops out of the range of the beacon, it becomes tricky for the application to extract exact information since the updates don&#8217;t get recorded in the real time.<\/p>\n<p>The developers can resolve such issues using time based heuristics so that they can easily determine that the users are still present or not. Other than this, there are business logic scripts which help in determining current trends, statistical analysis and drawing conclusions.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>\u00a0<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/top-7-reasons-to-why-restaurants-need-a-user-friendly-mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">Top 7 Reasons to Why Restaurants Need a User-Friendly Mobile App<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 17px\">6. The App Store Review Process During iBeacon App Development<\/h3>\n<p>Navigating the app store is one of the problems developers face during the iBeacon app development. So to resolve this issue, it is important to clearly mention the purpose and working of the application in both public description and review notes. Along with it, don\u2019t forget to add a demo video explaining features of the application and battery disclaimer at the end of the description.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/contact-us\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Hire-iBeacon-App-Developers.jpg\" alt=\"hire ibeacon app developer\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>An iBeacon app developer faces above-mentioned challenges during iBeacon app development that other app developers don&#8217;t encounter.
