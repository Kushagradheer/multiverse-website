So let\u2019s start with:<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">1. Maintaining App Compatibility with Different iOS Versions and Devices<\/h2>\n<p>There is no secret that Apple tends to release the latest iOS versions every year. The company launched its latest version iOS 13 in September 2019 exactly one year after the release of iOS 12 in September 2018. Every version comes with technological advancements that require the up-gradation of available apps to meet the standards of the improved iOS versions.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, the iOS developers need to examine the compatibility of every iOS application with different iOS devices including iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch. It helps in determining problems. If any, they need to be resolved in time. Else compatibility issues across different devices and different size screens can lead to a loss for <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apple_Inc.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">Apple company<\/span><\/a> customers.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">2. Getting Control of Storage and Memory Limitations of iOS Devices<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Getting-Control-of-Storage-and-Memory-Limitations.jpg\" alt=\"iphone app storage\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With iOS devices, restrictions of storage and memory are one of the most common challenges for the iOS developers. Because they do not have a garbage collection function like Android devices. Fundamentally, this function helps in identifying the objects which are no longer in use by the program and discard them so that the resources can be reused.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, it\u2019s a challenge for an iPhone app development company or when you hire iOS developers for your iOS application project that they maintain a sheer balance between the app performance and the memory constraints of the device.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, the application is developed for a single version of iOS and the same app runs on different devices. Supporting that iOS version based on their storage and memory constraints. In case any app needs more space then there are chances that the hardware can showcase the app unusable.<\/p>\n<p>Such issues can only be resolved, aiming at the app performance by eliminating redundant features that makes it heavier.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Modern iPhone App Development: To-do list app (coding tutorial as done at FANG)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hwkL_jNWCBw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">3. Fighting Poor Battery Life Challenge While iPhone App Development<\/h2>\n<p>It has been easier for iOS app developers to develop a superb app furnished with a multitude of features. But at the same time, the application must be high in performance and not consume much of battery life. If there will be no trade-off between app performance and battery life, customers would not take time to uninstall the application. So the hire iOS developers should beware of developing battery-friendly applications incorporated with powerful features.

Keeping Users Intact with Appropriate UI\/UX Design<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Keeping-Users-Intact-with-Appropriate-UI-UX-Design.gif\" alt=\"iphone app UI\" \/><\/p>\n<p>iOS applications are highly popular in the app market due to their superior user experience and clean design concept. So these are things which an iPhone app development company or hire iOS developers should keep in mind while developing an application.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the app interface should contain only the necessary functions and features to provide a user-friendly process flow.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this, keeping an eye over the latest UI\/UX trends can give you an edge over your competitor as the app designs are constantly changing with time.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>\u00a0<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/factors-that-rules-the-cost-of-an-ios-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">Factors That Rules the Cost of iOS App Development<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">5. Obtaining App Store Approvals for iPhone Apps<\/h2>\n<p>In the first quarter of 2019, there were around 1.84 million apps available to download on Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/in\/ios\/app-store\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">App Store<\/span><\/a>. And the count is increasing daily. But deploying an application on the App Store is not that easy since it follows stringent guidelines and violation of a simple rule can result in rejection of your application. Also, these development guidelines from the tech giant keep on updating on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>So, iOS app developers and the iPhone app development company must stay aware of Apple\u2019s updated guidelines and latest standards of content code, metadata, intellectual property rights, and others.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">6. Ensuring iPhone Application Security<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Ensuring-Application-Security.jpg\" alt=\"app security\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this digital era when we are witnessing the increased use of innovative technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Developing Cross-Platform Apps<\/h2>\n<p>In the market, there are companies that are aiming at the development of applications that can run on multiple platforms rather than only on a single platform. The Cross-platform applications offer users the synchronicity of application\u2019s access across multiple devices (desktops, laptops, phones, and tablets) and operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux.<\/p>\n<p>In the current date, for an enterprise willing to develop an application. It does not matter whether the app will be pure content-based, video-based, or document-based. Yet it should be accessible over a multitude of devices without any platform dependency.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">8. Future-Proofing iPhone App Development<\/h2>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Future-Proofing-Applications.jpg\" alt=\"ios app for future\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the current era when technology is evolving at a rapid pace, developing future-proof iOS apps seems difficult at first. Since your application will be seen outdated after 2-3 years. And knowing about the forthcoming Apple\u2019s innovation in advance is kind of an unpredictable feat.<\/p>\n<p>But limited iOS developers can estimate Apple\u2019s upcoming changes in the iOS versions considering Apple\u2019s line of products and thinking.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>\u00a0<a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/default-iphone-apps-can-now-be-uninstalled-in-ios-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">Default iPhone Apps Can Now Be Uninstalled In iOS 10<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">9. Ensuring App Performances in Low-Speed Networks<\/h2>\n<p>In current times, network speed may not be a major issue due to the presence of numerous network providers. However, the concern may be associated with the video downloads, streaming services, and other features that consume a lot of data. Therefore, to check the performance of the application, data checks need to be performed strategically through application optimization.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 5% 0 0 0;color: #3366ff\">10. Poor Beta Testing While iOS App Development<\/h2>\n<p>Beta Testing is an essential part of iPhone app development before its deployment on Apple\u2019s App Store.
