Yet the ones which are most sought after will cost you premium around thousands or even in millions.<\/p>\n<p>The most popular and highly preferable domain name extension among others is &#8216;.com&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> If you are looking to purchase a premium or highly preferred domain name, it will cost you around thousands as its initial price.

Without hosting you can\u2019t think of a website.<\/p>\n<p>While setting up a website, you can avoid the cost of purchasing a domain name as mentioned above that several website builders provide it as a part of their paid plans. But buying hosting is an unavoidable costing factor in website development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Available website builders in the market offer hosting and domain name purchasing aid as a bundle in just the payment of a small monthly fee.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for a website hosting for your WordPress website, the most recommended and always ranks top in search of WordPress hosting is Bluehost. Even WordPress recommends Bluehost for its WordPress websites.<\/p>\n<p>In the big scenario of WordPress website development, the hosting costs very little as compared to others. Have a look at different types of hostings from Bluehost and their monthly pricing.<\/p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Hosting type<\/th>\n<th>Bluehost prices\/month<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shared hosting<\/td>\n<td>$2.95-$13.95<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VPS hosting<\/td>\n<td>$18.99-$59.99<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dedicated hosting<\/td>\n<td>$79.99-$119.99<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> The prices mentioned here get updated from time to time.

Bluehost\u2019s VPS plan is capable of handling that surge in website traffic and costs you around $18.99\/month only.<\/p>\n<p>The websites which witness traffic more than a thousand visitors a month, moving to a dedicated hosting plan is an ideal choice.
