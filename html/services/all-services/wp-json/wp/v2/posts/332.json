Hence, Airbnb is running like a horse and making billions of bucks.<\/p>\n<p>Before we go any further, let\u2019s have a look how Airbnb was born:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"single-thumbnail-wrapper\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-334 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/airbnb.png\" alt=\"Airbnb \" width=\"402\" height=\"125\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In year 2007 two people Chesky and Gebbia could not pay their rent. It was a big problem for them, but they turned this problem into an opportunity. They thought of serving an air bed &amp; breakfast, this idea worked and they earned $240 from 1 woman and 2 men. Afterward, they thought to make this idea huge, so they launched a website Airbedandbreakfast.com on August 11, 2008.<\/p>\n<p>However, they were not making significant money in the beginning, but they kept on working. Later, they recognized a problem with the room listing photos. They realized that the photos were not good looking so they started taking pretty photos of rooms on their own. This helped them grow their business and this is how the successful journey of Airbnb was begun.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen how Airbnb looked when it was an infant in the industry, but it is not an infant anymore. It has become a vibrant billion dollar firm, the paragraph below is a proof of that.<\/p>\n<p>In February 2014 Airbnb listed 300,000 rooms on its website, this figure reached a milestone of one million in December 2014.
