Whether you are developing a new app for one of your clients or you are developing it for your own business, in most of the cases you need to build it for at least 3 major mobile platforms Android, iOS, and Windows.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it is quite baffling whether you should make it Native, Hybrid or Web app. Before you come to the decision, let\u2019s have a brief overview of these three app types.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Native Apps<\/h2>\n<p>Native apps are usually developed to work on a single mobile platform using the native programming language. For instance, Java for Android, Objective-C for iOS and .net for Windows. Once, the app is developed and launched, it can be installed from the Google play (For Android), iTunes App store (For iOS) &amp; Microsoft app store (For Windows).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Pros of Native Mobile Apps<\/h3>\n<p>\u2022 Easily available in standard play stores<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Offers better security and performance level<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 With native apps, it is easier to integrate all the mobile device features such as camera, GPS, fingerprint security, sensors, gyroscope and much more.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Cons of Native Apps<\/h3>\n<p>\u2022 One of the biggest drawbacks of developing a native mobile app is that it requires separate efforts to develop for each of the platforms (iOS, Android, Windows).<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Some of the native apps are often too expensive<\/p>\n<div class=\"single-thumbnail-wrapper\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-427 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/pexels-photo.jpg\" alt=\"Native Apps\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" \/><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Hybrid Apps<\/h2>\n<p>Typically built with the combination of languages, including CSS 3, HTML 5 and JavaScript. Unlike Native apps, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/cross-platform-app-development\/\">Hybrid app development<\/a><\/strong> doesn\u2019t need separate efforts for each mobile platform. They are developed once and can be made available in all the app stores to be downloaded.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Pros of Hybrid apps<\/h3>\n<p>\u2022 Offer more customization options for users<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Often requires less development time compared to a fully native mobile app<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 The use of web technology (HTML 5 and CSS 3) in Hybrid apps makes it much easier to develop than the native one.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Can support for dynamic content<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Because the web technology is almost similar for all platforms, it is possible to reuse the code without the need to start from scratch.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Cons of Hybrid Apps<\/h3>\n<p>\u2022 May get rejected by app stores<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Not as fast as Native apps<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 It is difficult to make a very complex app with Hybrid structure<\/p>\n<div class=\"single-thumbnail-wrapper\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-429 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/webapps.jpeg\" alt=\"Hybrid Apps\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Web Apps<\/h2>\n<p>Web apps are also built with the use of CSS 3, JavaScript and HTML 5 and can be accessed through mobile browsers. If designed properly, web apps can also be made work similar to native apps.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Pros of Web Apps<\/h3>\n<p>\u2022 Common for all users, irrespective of hardware or operating system<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 No need for approval from different app stores<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Requires less <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/7-vital-ingredients-that-affect-the-cost-of-app-development\/\">cost of app development<\/a><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Cons of Web Apps<\/h3>\n<p>\u2022 Have very limited access to the mobile hardware features<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 As the web apps are not listed on the standard play stores, it might be typical for users to find them.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">How to make a decision: Native vs Hybrid vs The Web<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before you make a decision, you need to think about some important factors such as cost, time frame, the performance requirement, type of app, etc. In many cases, Hybrid would be the right choice whereas some other high-performance app may only need to be native. If you can afford to pay for all native (Android, iOS, and Windows) developers and you are not restricted for the time, then it\u2019s great to make it native. But if you have limited resources and money, then it would be a wise decision to go with Hybrid or Web app.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, the choice of application type completely depends on your expectations, budget. and time-limit. Native mobile applications may provide you the best user experience but need more efforts and time. On the other side, Hybrid apps are quite inexpensive but need to be carefully developed for all platforms. Actually, there is no one size fits all solution, decide your own business needs and make the right choice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile app development is a rapidly growing field all over the world.
