I think it will be really an exciting thing for you.<\/p>\n<div class=\"single-thumbnail-wrapper\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-147 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/download.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 10 iPhone Apps\" width=\"700\" height=\"342\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Yes, finally a piece of good news on your door, now you could remove default apps from your iPhone, iPad or iPod. Apple has recently announced that users could uninstall default iPhone apps from their Apple devices in its new operating system.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is launching this <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/ios-10-features-release-date\">feature in upcoming iOS 10<\/a> which is scheduled to be launch in September 2016. Now users can get rid of unused space from their iPhone device and are free to uninstall their Maps, calculator, contact app, music, videos, iBooks, and much more.<\/p>\n<p>Users will be able to uninstall their default apps from the iPhone just like they do on their Android phones, there is no additional requirement for this.<\/p>\n<p>According to an update by the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-3639876\/Finally-Apple-let-users-delete-apps-FaceTime-Stocks-new-version-iOS.html\">MacRumors<\/a>, the apps you would be able to uninstall are iCloud Drive, iTunes Store, iBooks, Contacts, FaceTime, My Friends, Calendar, Home, Mail, Maps, Music, Notes, News, Podcast, Reminders Memos, Watch app and Weather. But still, there are a lot of questions in users mind regarding this feature that is it safe to remove the default iPhone apps from the system? The reason behind this curiosity is that removing a built-in iPhone app from the device will remove the user related data and configuration files. Also, if you remove the contact app then it will remove the individual contacts as well.<\/p>\n<p>Many users have experienced this on their Android devices that the contact info and the user related credentials were gone away with the deleted app. Hope, it will not happen on Apple devices.<\/p>\n<p>If you are using the previous versions of the Apple operating system and want to switch on this new iOS 10 to get this feature, the minimum required RAM should be more than 512 MB.<\/p>\n<p>Modern phones like iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S plus and iPhone SE are already having the RAM more than 512 MB and can handle iOS 10 without any hassle. Phones those are having RAM more than 512 MB and already upgraded to iOS 8, will work well on iOS 10 as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"single-thumbnail-wrapper\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-150 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/iphone-apps.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 10 default apps feature\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now if I talk about more features than I am sure that Apple will improve its voice assistant Siri as Apple does every year. It is expected that Siri will handle your voicemails and tell the caller \u2018why are you not picking the phone\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is improving its camera quality also. They have made certain changes in exposure compensation for each image, shutter speed control, focus and so on.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find more features you could check our recent post about iOS 10 features. Truly, iOS 10 will boom and skyrocket with these expected features.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you regularly use the default iPad or iPhone apps in your Apple devices, if not then I think you have been frustrated for long because you are unable to uninstall these type of unused Apple apps?
