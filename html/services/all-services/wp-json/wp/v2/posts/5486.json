It will be officially available for the consumer after few months of its beta release.<\/p>\n<div class=\"single-thumbnail-wrapper\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-190 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/ios-10-image.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 10 features\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">World Wide Developers Conference 2016<\/h2>\n<p>Apple has released the dates for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macworld.co.uk\/feature\/apple\/wwdc-2017-dates-how-get-wwdc-2017-tickets-wwdc-2017-announced-3522648\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WWDC 2016<\/a> which will take place on June 13, 2016, to June 17, 2016, in San Francisco. That means we only have to wait a few weeks before Apple reveals iOS 10.<\/p>\n<p>The iOS 10 beta will be available to developers at the same time, while public beta may launch in July, as they did it same for the iOS 9. You will be able to download iOS 10 beta in June 2016 &amp; final release may take place in September.<\/p>\n<p>I have collected several pieces of data that talk about iOS 10 and gathered them together. This will give you an idea about the expected features of iOS 10.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">iOS 10 Compatibility<\/h3>\n<p>Surprisingly, iPhone 4S &amp; iPad 2 will still work with new OS update. However, iOS 10 may require RAM more than 512 MB. Other iPhone models like iPhone 6S, iPhone 6, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPhone 6 plus, iPhone 6S plus will be able to handle iOS 10 without any hassle. Same will happen to the iPad Pro 9.7, 12.9, iPad Air 2, iPad Air, iPad mini 3, iPad 4, iPad mini 2. If your smartphone has got upgraded to iOS 8, then it is also compatible with iOS 10. Therefore, without any investment on the flagship smartphone, you can have the chance to use the latest iOS software version.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Siri and Voicemails<\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-191 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/iphone-siri.jpg\" alt=\"Voice mail ios 10\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>It is fully expected that Apple will improve its voice assistant \u201cSiri\u201d because every year Apple does so. But this time it is expected that Siri will handle your voicemails. One of the big iOS 10 rumors is that Siri will be able to tell the caller why you can&#8217;t pick up the phone &amp; even transcribe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/Apple-is-preparing-to-launch-a-voicemail-service-that-will-use-Siri-to-transcribe-your-messages\/articleshow\/48329361.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">voicemail messages<\/a> so you can read it further.<\/p>\n<p>Apple will send the voice data to company servers, where Siri will convert the words into text. iCloud voicemail will function in the same way, sending the voicemails to apple, &amp; Siri will transcribe and make available to your iPhone. It is estimated that it will be a major feature of upcoming iOS 10.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Apple Home Kit<\/h3>\n<p>Your home is going to become advanced &amp; fully technical with iOS 10 device. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/3067368\/internet-of-things\/apple-homekit-may-get-an-official-controller-app-in-ios-10.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Home&#8217;s app<\/a> will work with your home bulbs, doorbells, thermostats, door locks &amp; all sort of tech gadgets.

Thus, Apple must realize the significance of messaging &amp; come up with an advanced messaging feature in iOS 10.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Cola which is the world&#8217;s first messaging OS, designing to make messaging more powerful, easy for users &amp; users will able to chat in a hassle free way without leaving a conversation in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Cola is available on iOS &amp; now planning to expand the capabilities of text messages. So apple may implement some new features of cola&#8217;s work in iOS 10 like sharing live maps that update their location &amp; many other features that make messaging a great experience.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Detailed weather forecasting mobile App<\/h3>\n<p>iOS may give better weather forecasting in its inbuilt weather iOS application. As you have seen in previous iOS versions, weather forecasting app is failed to give detailed information about weather, users download other weather forecasting apps from Apple store to resolve this problem. Now, iOS 10 will give their users inbuilt better weather forecasting app for superior user experience.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Better 3D touch integration<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.uk\/apple-ios-10-concept-video-how-control-center-3d-touch-support-could-look-iphone-7-1546653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3D Touch<\/a> is one of the best features of the iPhone 6S, but so far it has been limited to uses on the home screen.

You must have seen, with iPhone 6S, Apple made some hardware changes for better camera capabilities. Similarly, in iOS 10, you will probably see some changes with its camera, independently control the shutter speed, exposure compensation for each image, ISO, white balance, focus.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"entry-title\">Multi-User Support<\/h3>\n<p>Apple did a great effort in iOS 9 for its iPad series. Split Screen multitasking &amp; better Bluetooth keyboard support that made a huge difference. Apple has not given this multi-user support in its iPhone line. This is something innovation Android tablets have but apple devices iPhone doesn&#8217;t.
