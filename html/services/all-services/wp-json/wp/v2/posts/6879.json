There are several applications of effective augmented reality development. For instance, it can be used for displaying score overlays on the telecasted sports or games and even for popping up 3D emails, text messages, or photos on mobile devices. The leaders of the <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mobile application development<\/a> industry are making use of the AR development technology for implementing amazing &amp; revolutionary applications with the use of motion-activated commands and holograms.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read More:<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-transforming-the-enterprises\/\">How Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are Transforming the Enterprises<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Though both of these might appear the same, there are some points of difference between the two.

Here are some points for you to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose:<\/strong> AR is aimed at enhancing the overall user experiences through the addition of using virtual components like the digital photos, graphics, or even sensations as some new layer of interaction with the real world. On the other hand, VR is aimed at creating its own reality technology that tends to be generated and driven by the computer system completely.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Method of Delivery<\/strong>: VR is primarily used for being provided to the end users through some hand-held\/head-mounted controller. This device is used for connecting people to the technology of virtual reality. As such, it also allows the end users to bring about an effective control as well as the navigation of their respective actions in the given guided environment for stimulating the real world.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the other hand, the technology of augmented reality (AR) is being utilized for enhancing the services by several mobile devices including smartphones, laptops, and tablets by changing how the real world, as well as the digital forms of images &amp; graphics, interact and intersect with the end users.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">How do VR &amp; AR Work Together?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>There is not the scenario of <strong>AR vs. VR<\/strong> in most of the cases. Sometimes, these technologies are not able to operate independently or free from one another. In fact, these technologies are mostly blended together towards generating an increasingly immersing user experience. For instance, haptic feedback \u2013referred to as the vibration &amp; the sensation that is added to the interaction with high-end graphics \u2013is regarded as the form of augmented reality technology. Similarly, it is also commonly used within a specialized VR setting for making the overall user experience appear more lifelike in touch &amp; sensation.<\/p>\n<p>AR &amp; VR are great instances of amazing interactions and user experiences fueled by the need for becoming greatly immersed in some simulated land for the purpose of entertainment &amp; playing experiences, or towards adding a completely new dimension of user interaction between different digital devices &amp; the given real world. Whether independent or blended together, these high-end technologies are undoubtedly opening up several high-tech scenarios for both the real as well as virtual worlds alike.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) seem to be two related terms, but these are different from each other on several grounds.
