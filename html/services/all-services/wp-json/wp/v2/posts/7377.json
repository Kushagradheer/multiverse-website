Starting with what it is, in the simplest terms, it is the concept of connecting various things or smart devices as they are called, to the internet. The platform of <strong>The Internet of Things<\/strong> brings diverse information together and provides the common language of devices and apps to communicate with each other.<\/p>\n<p>IoT, since its arrival changed the paradigm of technology entirely. Even our daily routine activities have transformed since the arrival of IoT, from how we drive, to how we make purchases, to how we make use of energy in our homes.<\/p>\n<p>The arrival of IoT took place at a very convenient time; when users were looking for something to make their lives more convenient and easy, which is why IoT is such a big hit! You can check out the <strong><a href=\"#infographic\">infographic below<\/a><\/strong> for more details about IoT.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/DZMIiiQXUAUf9k6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/DZMIiiQXUAUf9k6.jpg\" alt=\"impact of IoT on app development stats\" width=\"655\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">IoT impact on App Development<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>There is a link between IoT and Mobile App development. The technology of IoT has been embraced by <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app developers<\/a><\/strong> since it came into existence and app developers are trying to input IoT in their apps so that they can stay ahead of their competition by all means.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Following are some of the ways in which IoT has affected mobile app development-<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Reduction in Human Effort-<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The assistance that IoT has provided us with is beyond the expected level. It has made life easier for both the users and the app developers in so many ways.<br \/>\nWith so much interactivity of the internet with the devices, technology has been able to manage a lot of tasks for the users.<\/p>\n<p>This, in turn, has reduced the effort that developers have to put in to complete the building of an app.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Change of Focus of Apps-<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Initially, the focus of app developers lied in making the interface friendly for the users.\u00a0 Now, that focus is shifting towards making the integration between the app and the smart devices more effective.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Giving Priority to Making the App More Secure-<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The integration that takes place between the internet and surrounding devices uses the data of the user. The information is passed on and the data gets encrypted. There is a possibility that the data contains sensitive information of the user, which would be open to cybercrime.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, app developers need to lay their focus on making the apps more secure and safe. This is important so that the user&#8217;s privacy does not get hampered in any case.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Specialisation in IoT App Development-<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The technology of IoT requires a completely new and unified specialization.<\/p>\n<p>By the rate at which IoT is moving forward, every business would want to invest in developing IoT specialized apps &amp; would not shy away from hiring specialists in this field.<\/p>\n<p>This is not just to stay ahead of their competition, but also to be constantly accessible by the users.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Modification of Apps-<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apps that don&#8217;t support connectivity with surrounding devices, don&#8217;t have a stable chance to stay in the market.\u00a0 Developers are therefore investing more time in improvising their apps to make them adaptable to IoT.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Industries That Are Benefiting From IoT App Development <\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Every app belongs to a specific category for which it gets developed. For instance, an app that can monitor the number of steps you are walking in a day would be a part of the health sector.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, an app that lets you shop online, would be a part of the category of the retail sector. Now, app developers are trying to make use of IoT solutions in every sector. That is increasing the productivity in these sectors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The industries that have benefited the most because of apps that support IoT are :<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#healthcare\">Healthcare<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#energy\">Energy<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#retail\">Retail<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong id=\"healthcare\">1.
