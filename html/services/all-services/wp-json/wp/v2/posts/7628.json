The education sector is not being left behind as well and is trying to embody live streaming into their techniques. It makes both concepts of teaching and learning effective, because of the enhanced interest it seeks.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, we are quite familiar with the fact that the internet is enabling us to connect with each other. Now, we have reached a time where devices are able to connect with each other, thanks to the Internet of Things. Every sector is adapting the <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/what-is-the-internet-of-things-iot-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>technology of IoT<\/strong><\/a> to generate better results, and the education sector is no different.<\/p>\n<p>In this blog, you&#8217;ll find the benefits of both live streaming and IoT in the education sector.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Benefits of using Live Streaming in Education Sector<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Evolving Teaching Methods:<\/h3>\n<p>For a very long time, we are using the classroom-style teaching, which after a point, felt boring. The drawback was that this<br \/>\nlearning did not even retain itself in the minds of the students for more than two months!<\/p>\n<p>It does not come as a surprise that practical learning always has a greater impact on learning. With the live streaming methodology of teaching, there is a higher chance that the knowledge will retain for a longer time.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Performance Analysis:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Teaching has now become a two-way process. Every administration would want to be able to assess the student&#8217;s performance and evaluate them. At the same time, they would also want to be able to cater and give the complete space to the requirements of the students.<\/p>\n<p>This helps in providing a better learning environment for the students and an enhanced and interactive teaching experience for the faculties.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Cost-Effectiveness:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It does not come as a surprise that studying has become very expensive in every sense today. Even on an average, factor in all the costs of academics and that would go up to around $150. This is not even inclusive of all the books and transportation costs.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, with live streaming, the maximum cost would be of the internet connection or the electricity charges. And that is still way less than the accumulated cost of traditional learning.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Enhanced Digital Interactivity:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The mainstream learning techniques where the teacher and student had to be in front of each other is no longer there. With the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vedantu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apps like Vedantu<\/a>, the teacher and student can interact online.<\/p>\n<p>This also benefits both the students and teachers in having a dynamic and diverse exposure since this digital learning can take place with anywhere from across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Also, live streaming has lifted off the barrier that students could only interact with the teachers in front of them. Digital exposure has allowed them to interact with experts in their field from all around the world!<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7631\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7631\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7631 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/vedantu-IoT-Live-Streaming-Benefiting-the-Education-Sector.png\" alt=\"IoT &amp; Live Streaming Benefiting the Education Sector\" width=\"750\" height=\"401\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Vedantu<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Bringing enthusiasts together:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Collaboration has become pretty much easier since the arrival of Live Streaming. It has eliminated the issue of the geographical location of a person completely.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if a group of students has to complete a project together, and if one of them is away, their physical proximity would no longer be required. With live streaming, they can connect with each other via online mediums, and can complete the task at hand.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, parents and teachers can also connect with each other without having to miss out on anything based on them being somewhere distant!<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. A higher rate of hiring:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Because of live streaming, the entire dimension of how we hire someone is changing. A few years back, there was a very fixed order on how everything took place.<\/p>\n<p>We go to school, get higher education and after its completion, get a job. Live streaming has changed the spectrum of that as well! With us having so much access to the world and the world having so much access to us, it is pretty evident that scenarios are changing.<\/p>\n<p>There is no fixed time for you to get hired anymore. If you&#8217;re good at something and show diligence, chances are someone would watch you and hire you! Indirectly, the future of the education sector in context with live streaming is also causing a reduction in unemployment rates.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Dynamic Learning Opportunities:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Live streaming would open up a lot of opportunities in terms of learning. Students get exposed to more subjects in every field, and that would enhance their skill set. Also, this way they can keep in touch with the changing facets of current trends.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Mobile Learning:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Amongst other things, retention rate with mobile learning is very high. On an average, most of the people have their phones with them at all times. This allows students to have access to live streaming, anytime and anywhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mobile app development companies<\/a><\/strong> are specifically using this need and providing the option of live streaming in mobiles.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">The inclusion of Internet of Things in Education Sector<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7637 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/internet-of-things-education.jpg\" alt=\"IoT &amp; Live Streaming Benefiting the Education Sector\" width=\"750\" height=\"516\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>IoT is playing a significant role in driving the growth of the education sector.
