For the same reason, they are trying their hands on AR and VR.<\/p>\n<p>The applications based on these technologies allow a better interaction with the product. Let&#8217;s say for an example, you can visualize how the centre table will look like in your dining space.<\/p>\n<p>Sectors like banking, automotive, retail, travel, consumer products, and hospitality are using AR\/VR to increase their customers&#8217; experiences.<\/p>\n<p>If we talk about the advantages that these technologies are offering to these sectors, then we may see that there is a sudden hike in the revenue, brand positioning, advertisement, affecting marketing, and fewer bad response of the product.<\/p>\n<p>Example: Real-Estate companies are opting for the <strong>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality app development <\/strong>applications for offering a better property view. A customer can explore either the built or planned project from various angles.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, AR technology was implemented at the Seoul Incheon Airport to guide the traveller smartly. It guides them from the airport to the Pyeongchang with the help of AR application which shows directions and notifications.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong> Learning and Training:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>AR\/VR applications are making their way in the education and training sector too. Companies are using these technologies to train their employees for the extreme situations by creating a havoc environment for them.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, these applications find a great place in the medical sector as well. Doctors can perform virtual heart surgeries and thus reduces any probable risk in real time. Also, people suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) can comfort by teaching them to manage their stress.<\/p>\n<p>For, most of these applications, it is required to wear a headset for completely immerge into that environment.<\/p>\n<p>Example: To help the patients of PTSD, University of Southern California <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma\/story?id=38742665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">are researching<\/a> more on these technologies to identify methods to provide relief to the patients.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong> Engineering Design and Analysis:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Companies are moving ahead to incorporate AR \/ VR into their work culture by using the applications to enhance the productivity, development time, and reduce cost.<\/p>\n<p>Designers are using a headset to plan, model, design and test the products in real-time simulation. Company domains like Automobile manufacturers, Aerospace, Real-Estate, Semiconductor IC manufacturer, etc.<\/p>\n<p>AR\/VR also provides an ability for the companies to analyze the data by visualizing the trends and manipulate the complex data to see the outcomes. Moreover, many banking sectors are using data visualizations to enhance the novel methods that can help customers better.<\/p>\n<p>Sectors like Education, Banking, finance, and investment, etc are using this application to manage and plan their strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Example: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2016\/05\/23\/nasa-hololens-mars-rover-in-mixed-reality\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NASA<\/a> is using the immersive technologies to design the upcoming Mars Rover.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong> Guiding New Employee or Visitors:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Keeping in the mind the awkwardness that a newbie faces on the first day of the office, <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/augmented-reality-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Augmented Reality app developers<\/strong><\/a> came up with an idea to develop an application that guides the new employee through the company premises.<\/p>\n<p>It can guide you about the seating arrangements, telling you about the designated person details about name, hobbies, role in the company, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The plus point of this application is that it will tell the employee about the company&#8217;s work. Also, what are their methodologies of doing a work, the location of the departments?<\/p>\n<p>Example: Beam, a design and digital marketing agency have implemented an AR-based headset. This app guides the employee to the whole premises of the company.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Challenges of AR and VR applications:<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Although these immersive technologies are providing great experiences to the users and companies, still they have a long way ahead in becoming the most reliable technology. The following are the key challenges that are the hurdle to a virtual future:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Cost of Devices and Apps:<\/h3>\n<p>The VR headset is a bit quite expensive to buy. A normal HTC Vive and Oculus Rift cost $799 and $599, respectively. Moreover, the headset is tethered to the computer devices, that means, your computer should be capable of running high-end VR software.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, to run VR headset, you require VR software which adds to the cost of using the technology.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>Universal Standards:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>AR and VR will need to follow the universal standards to develop the applications. These applications will be capable enough to work or operate on the multiple headsets. If we talk about VR alone, then currently it is lacking in simple plug-and-play capabilities.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3>User Experience:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The manufacturers need to understand the fact that one size (head size) does not fit all. They need to come up with the adjustable headsets. Also, VR headsets make the user stationary at one place while bearing 500 grams of weight.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>To recapitulate<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It is always good and refreshing to incorporate latest trends and technologies into our work environment. This enhances our productivity and efficiency in improving usage of the resources. To offer best services and products to the customers, it requires an immense amount of hard work and knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>AR and VR offer broad benefits to the enterprises from healthcare sectors to aerospace sectors. The ongoing improvements in the performances are broadening the capabilities and opportunities of the applications based on AR and VR.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing the above ways that are creeping into the enterprises, we think it is the right time for the strategists, marketing managers, operation leaders, and mobile app developers to make greater applications that are helpful for humankind.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, enterprises can <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>hire a mobile app development company<\/strong><\/a> to develop an AR\/VR based application for them to enhance their quality of services and products.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8216;Technology&#8217; the word in itself covers an unimaginable and unexpected plethora of innovations.
