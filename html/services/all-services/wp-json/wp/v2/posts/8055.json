Watch 3 is considered to be the best wearable of Apple. Now, Apple is going to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/6\/5\/15730246\/apple-watch-update-announced-watchos-4-wwdc-2017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launch its latest watch 4 soon<\/a>. The watch is currently under development. In this article, we will discuss the third-party Apple watch faces.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">But before proceeding, we have to know about the <strong>watch faces<\/strong>. What the word watch faces actually mean? Watch faces are actually referred to the faces or sometimes dials of watches (both digital and analog). Talking about the smartwatches, watch faces are customizable. Hence, watch faces let users change the style of smartwatches.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8059 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/watchOS-4-Toy-Story-watch-faces-teaser-001.jpg\" alt=\"watchOS-4 Third Party Apple Watch Faces Support\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1079\" \/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Till now, other than Apple, only its partners including Pixar, Disney, etc. have the rights to develop watch faces for the Apple watches. But soon, we will get to hear that <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2015\/08\/18\/apple-watch-custom-watch-faces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developers can design their own watch faces<\/a> and share them with fellow Apple Watch wearers.<\/p>\n<p>Well, this news is true or a rumor, nobody knows. This prediction came from a report of <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/04\/14\/watchos-4-3-1-suggests-future-support-for-third-party-watch-faces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9to5Mac which uncovered the code for WatchOS 4.3.1<\/a> along with a log message. The log message is as follows, \u201c<strong><em>This is where the 3rd party face config bundle generation would happen<\/em><\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s have a look some of the features of this latest watch of Apple. Do note that we are not sure about these features of the upcoming release of Apple Watch. These are only the predictions about the latest version.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Design of Apple Watch 4<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Most of the Android smartwatches have round face. A recent rumor suggests that Apple is also going to design its upcoming watch in such a shape. It is believed that the circular displays or the displays with curved edges have more efficient use of space in terms of pixel arrays. However, the Apple argues the fact.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Bigger and Round screen of the watch<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8063\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-watch-series-3-and-series-4-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Third Party Apple Watch Faces Support\" width=\"850\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It is also expected that the Apple Watch 4 series have screen 15% larger as compared to its predecessors. Currently, Apple watches come in two screen sizes: 38mm and 42mm.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2015, Apple filed a patent for using a strap with the battery. Which is why it is contemplated that with the arrival of the Apple Watch Series 4, a first-party solution would also be made available:<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-watch-battery-strap.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch battery starp\" \/> <span><em>Not everyone wants a square watch, so we&#8217;d like to see a circular option.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span>image source: USPTO, via PatentlyApple<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong><span lang=\"EN\">2. Improved battery life on the upcoming Apple Watch 4<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2017\/01\/03\/report-new-apple-watch-coming-in-third-quarter-of-2017-main-focus-on-better-battery-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to the 9to5Mac<\/a>, Kuo said that the Apple Watch 4 series will have better battery life as compared to its previous versions. However, in his statement, he did not mention how much better will be the battery life. If we talk about the previous version of the Apple Watch (Apple Watch 3), it delivers up to 18 hours of productivity on battery.<\/p>\n<p>If we compare the Apple Watch series with some of its competitors, Apple will have to do a lot more in order to improve the battery life of its wearables. The Fitbit Versa delivers productivity of up to 4 days on battery. On the other hand, Garmin Vivoactive remains productive for a maximum of 7 days.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>3. New health tracking sensors<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It may be possible that the users will get new and advanced health sensors on the latest Apple Watch 4 series. For now, it is not clear that what type of health sensors Apple is going to install in its latest model of the smartwatch. But from the past, it can easily be predicted that Apple is more concern to the health, hence will install more advanced health monitoring sensors.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, a few months ago, Apple conducted a program with the Stanford University to monitor the heart conditions of the Apple Watch users. The program was named as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/watch\/apple-heart-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Heart Study<\/a>. In the last December, Bloomberg stated in its report that the Apple was working on the latest technology to be installed on its upcoming versions of wearables. This technology will let users monitor their heart conditions just like an electrocardiogram.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/04\/12\/apple-working-on-glucose-sensors-diabetes-treatment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Some reports<\/a> also stated that the Apple is working to install a noninvasive glucose monitor on the upcoming series of Apple Watch.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"blogDetail_video\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:750px; height:300px;\" src=\"https:\/\/pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net\/VCPS\/Y2017\/M04D13\/3000610010\/5ED2-BL-Apple-041317_L.mp4\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>All in all, this will be a great step for Apple to install the health sensors on its Watch 4 series. Installing the new health sensors or upgrading the previous health sensors will prove to be useful in detecting the serious health conditions. With the help of such sensors, a user will remain updated with his health conditions. Hence, the suitable precautions will be taken by the user as Precautions are always better than cure.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>4. Sleep tracking on Apple Watch 4<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8060 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-watch4-sleep-tracking.jpg\" alt=\"sleep tracking on apple watch 4\" width=\"750\" height=\"419\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The previous versions of Apple Watch series did not have a built-in sleep tracking feature. However, users can install such features by downloading the related apps. There are a lot of apps available for sleep tracking. It is expected that the upcoming Apple Watch series will come with a built-in sleep tracking feature.<\/p>\n<p>With the help of sleep tracking feature, users can keep a track on their health. Hence, this feature will help users maintaining their health.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>5. Sports Tracking<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8061 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-watch4-Sports-Tracking.jpg\" alt=\"apple watch 4 sports tracking\" width=\"750\" height=\"419\" \/><br \/>\nApple is also going to upgrade its features in order to improve its sports tracking ability. Soon the advanced sports tracking features will be available on the Apple smartwatches.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>6. Improved Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>According to Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, Apple is planning to install new circuit boards on the upcoming Watch series. This step will boost the performance of the Apple Watches and will increase the productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Every coin has two sides. However, the idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>hire app developer<\/b><\/a> (third-party app developer) is good, yet it has some disadvantages. Let\u2019s see what are these minus points:<\/p>\n<p>Users\u2019 main concern before buying any product is its price. There is a possibility that the price of the Apple Watches may vary. On the other hand, Apple is well-known for its privacy terms. Hiring the third parties for <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/ios-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>iOS app development<\/b><\/a> may also risk the privacy of customers of the Apple. The third-party watch faces may ask users for sharing their some of the personal information. Moreover, it is also possible that such third-party watch faces will take some time to build trust in Apple\u2019s users.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Apple is very serious about the privacy of its users. Hence, it is difficult to say anything about the third-party Apple Watch face support.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On September 22, 2017, the Watch 3 of Apple had brought a new revolution in the world of technology.
