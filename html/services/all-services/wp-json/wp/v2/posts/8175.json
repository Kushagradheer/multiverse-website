Initially, there was a lot of debate and negative outlook that encompassed the segment of animation. This was because of the fact that anything in motion gave the notion of a pop-up or advertisement.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, the only reflexive action that would come out would be to close that page! However, that perception has of course changed over time. Animations are no longer looked upon that way and have become an integral part of providing <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/ux-design-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>UI design services<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>How can Animation enhance the Experience of Users on an App?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Anything that is in a moving state or is in motion always engages a user more than how a normal graphic would. This is the main reason why <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/mobile-application-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>mobile\u00a0app\u00a0developers<\/strong><\/a> indulge in animation, even though it is a bit tedious. Some other ways due to which animations are so important are:<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Gives life to your interface<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Even when a user is not performing any intricate task on an app, there are a lot of calculations and work taking place in the background. There might be some data downloading from the server, or something else.<\/p>\n<p>Now, these processes take time and meanwhile, might give your app a frozen look. Which is why developers should use animation to show that there is some ongoing process happening. This sign of process would make the user feel like they are in charge of the app and they have the power of navigating around.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Make the waiting time interesting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>No matter what, one thing that every user consistently hates is waiting. There are hardly any users who would have the patience to wait around while your web app is loading.<\/p>\n<p>The problem here is, there is nothing you can do about the waiting time. What you can do is, use animation techniques to make that wait time interesting. Even though that would not reduce the time it takes for the page to load, it would at least keep the users attention on the web app.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Notify in an interactive way<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>By the name itself, notifications stand for demanding the attention of the users. What better of informing them about something important other than using the most interactive way!<br \/>\nMoving objects immediately grab attention, and you can then notify the users about whatever it was without making it annoying.\u00a0Using a motion would attract the users,<\/p>\n<img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"wp-image-8177 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/animation-notifications.gif\" alt=\"animation notifications User Interface Design\"\/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>Use animation to navigate users<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>How would the users know that they are moving from one location to another on a website or a web app? Rather than doing that in an abrupt manner, you can make use of animation to navigate them.<\/p>\n<img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"wp-image-8179 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/navigation-animation-user-interface-1.gif\" alt=\"navigation animation User Interface Design\"\/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h4>This navigation can take place in various ways:<\/h4>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Smooth transitions<\/li>\n<li>Transporting from one location to another<\/li>\n<li>Setting a visual hierarchy to describe a connection between elements<\/li>\n<li>Designing a button whose functionality variates based on the situation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"wp-image-8180 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/function-change-animations-user-interface.gif\" alt=\"function change animations User Interface Design\"\/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>The response in the form of visuals<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>For any user, getting some feedback in the form of visuals is more than just necessary. This response would be the element because of which the user would feel that they have the power on the app and not the other way around.<\/p>\n<p>This can be done in many ways. For instance, the buttons would respond in a slight way when the user taps on it, acknowledging the move. At any point, using animation can enhance the interaction between a user and the app.<\/p>\n<p>On an unconscious level, users notice the smallest details. Through visuals, you can show responses using animation and that would mean a better experience of the users.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Read More:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/ux-vs-ui-infographic\/\">UX vs UI \u2013 What is the Difference? | Infographic<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>What is Conceptual Animation?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Moving towards the next facet of animation is the conceptual animation. It is a kind of motion design that conveys a particular idea before converting it into actuality. In User Interface Design, conceptual designs can be present in animations like transitions, or other interactions.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that conceptual animation is very different from the mainstream approaches is what makes it stand out and to an extent, controversial. Basically, Conceptual Animation is the trendsetter today.<\/p>\n<p>Every developer today is looking for a unique concept to set themselves apart from the others. This technique of animation is different than the other styles and goes beyond all the tested ideas.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8181 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/What-is-Conceptual-Animation.jpg\" alt=\"What is Conceptual Animation?

There can be two variants, the first one where the list simply moves up or down respectively.<br \/>\nOn the second one, there is a bit of a holdback after the user scrolls the list. This holdback gives more life to the animation and creates an idea that there is more space.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8182 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Scrolling-a-list-of-items-animation.gif\" alt=\"Scrolling animation user interface design\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>The transition from the list to item<\/strong><\/h4>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p>In this feature, the user navigates from the list to a particular item upon selecting any one item. There are two variants in this case too. The first one is where the transition happens in the most basic way.<br \/>\nThe second way, where more focus is given to the transition and that makes it more interactive.<\/p>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8183 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/transition-animation-user-interface.gif\" alt=\"transition animation User Interface Design\"\/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h4><strong>Opening side menu<\/strong><\/h4>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The side menu is a very common feature that any app developer uses<strong>.<\/strong> Using conceptual animation in this menu makes the appearance more elegant; like using the technique of gradually flowing of items.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Tutorials<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>You can refer the following tutorials to get a better idea of how you can incorporate the dynamic concepts of animation in your app development (iOS and Android) user interface design projects.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The guidelines of Building apps with Graphics and Animation will help you in adding a <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/training\/building-graphics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">motion in your Android app<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https:\/\/cgi.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/welcome-to-after-effects-overview-and-getting-started--ae-28388\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe After Effects<\/a> will help you in animation.<\/li>\n<li>You can use Custom animation for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Of4flwvlYz4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iOS projects<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The animation is a very elegant and powerful way to attract your users if used in a proper manner.
