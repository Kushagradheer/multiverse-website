As of now, the iPhone developer is supposedly in talks with companies like Snap &amp; Pinterest to join hands and come together in this network.<\/p>\n<p>According to reports, Apple would place ads in these companies\u2019 apps. All the revenue that the companies would generate from the <strong>App Ad Network<\/strong> would be shared between them and Apple. It is said that the apps that would be promoted will be displayed when the users search for some specific keywords that would match with the relevant app.<\/p>\n<p>As of now, Apple is in speculation to give in this advertisement network. However, the company is not new to investing in advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2010, Apple came up with an iAd App Network.\u00a0The aim of launching iAd was to place ads in mobile apps. However, Apple couldn&#8217;t generate enough attention of the users towards this service. Which is why they <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/support\/iad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shut it down<\/a> completely back in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike its competitors like Facebook, who have been more than prevalent in using their users\u2019 personal data and information, and revolving their entire businesses around advertising today, Apple is adamant to not do so.<\/p>\n<p>However, the scenario with Apple is highly different. The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook has been very critical that while targeting ads, they would not collect any information or data of the users that is more than relevant, making them different from the competitors!<\/p>\n<p>This new step by Apple would direct the tech giant right into a competition with Facebook and Google. But it would probably help developers and brands grow their products and enhance their reach.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not Apple will launch the app ad network is still not sure. And if they do, the time of its launch is still unknown. However, with the indulgence in this advertising network, Apple might bring forth some contradictions too.<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, these ads would prompt the users to download and use apps, and on the other hand, it comes as a contradiction of the idea set by Apple to train people to decrease the time they spend on apps and devices.<\/p>\n<p>For more app industry updates, refer to our <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Blog section<\/strong><\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rumors have it that Apple might be getting back in the advertising business anytime soon in the near future.
