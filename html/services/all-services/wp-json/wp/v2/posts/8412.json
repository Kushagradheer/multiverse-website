Apple, a brand which is known for its high-quality devices and operating system. There are 2 million mobile applications in an iOS app store. There are thousands of iPhone app developers. Apple has 1.3 billion active devices all around the globe which indicates that what is the demand for Apple devices.<\/p>\n<p>Quality has always been the primary reason behind purchasing Apple devices. Users find it surprising in performance as compared to other devices from different brands. Before Apple, Nokia was the leading mobile device company in the market of Asia. After a decade, Apple has taken over the market with a significant share of consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Apple first launched its iPod which was fundamentally used to listen and store songs. Later, they started manufacturing mobile devices and then added a few more product lines such as the tablet which is called iPad, Apple laptops and more.<\/p>\n<p>Apple devices are a matter of pride. From the beginning, the brand\u2019s marketing team has launched it and displayed it as a product of class and sophistication. Hence, we mentioned \u201c<em><strong>a matter of pride<\/strong><\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>With every new version of the operating system, Apple has proved that it delivers only high-quality products to their end users. The most important thing is the security it offers. Since Apple uses stringent rules, regulations, standards, and policies for mobile applications; there are no chances of the device getting hanged.

Users never expected it but the whole year was spent resolving the bugs identified in this operating system\u2019s new version. The team took a bit of time and had introduced iOS 12. There is an assumption that this update of OS will overcome all the problems that were present in the previous operating system iOS 11.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8414\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-features-Performance-Improvements.jpg\" alt=\"top iOS 12 features smooth performance\" width=\"750\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Users will be experiencing bug-free and smooth processing as expected. Devices will work faster than before. Apple states that older Apple devices will work around 40% to 70% faster. iOS mobile applications will launch 40% faster; the display of the keyboard will be 50% faster, camera application will shoot 70% faster. Other apps will work 2x faster as compared with the speed offered by iOS 11.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">You can make your own Memoji<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>This new feature sounds great! Personalization is the key to get into a space in the heart of the consumer. Apple has focused on personalization this time with memojis. You can create masks that look just like you. <strong>Users will be able to select eye colour, hairstyles, and accessories to add a sense of reality to those memojis<\/strong>. At present, this feature is available for only iPhone X users. It requires Apple\u2019s right depth front facing a camera.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8425 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-features-Memojis-and-Animojis.jpg\" alt=\"top iOS 12 features Memojis and Animojis\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FaceTime<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>iOS 11 had Grouped Notification and Group FaceTime. Now, with all other upgrades, iOS 12 has come up with FaceTime where the user can facetime 32 people simultaneously at a time. Now that is a huge number and a great feature! In this feature, people are showcased in a tiled interface. Here, the person who is speaking, his tile will automatically become larger. It will help the users keep track of the conversation. <strong>Users can use memojis while communicating through video chats<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8416\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-features-facetime.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features facetime\" width=\"750\" height=\"452\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Apple Books<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Do you love reading? Is reading your hobby or something you do to pass the time? Do you believe reading is the only way one can enhance the knowledge? Well, then this new feature is going to impress you the most. Apple books are all set to make readers happy with their latest design.<\/p>\n<p>It has become easier for users to read, discover and listen to their favourite books and audio books. The \u201c<strong>Reading Now<\/strong>\u201d tab has made this feature more user-friendly. It consolidates all books that the user is currently reading and yet to finish.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8428\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-features-Apple-books.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features apple books\" width=\"750\" height=\"448\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It also recommends you new books of the same genre that you have read before.

It is one of the most significant trends in technology and how can Apple stay behind in following this trend? They have launched multiplayer functionality in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/in\/newsroom\/2018\/06\/apple-unveils-arkit-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>ARKit 2<\/strong><\/a>, which has made playing multiplayer games more exciting.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8426\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8426\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8426 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-ios-12-features-arkit.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features arkit 2\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><span style=\"color: #999999;\">Playing AR slingshot games at a table with two people, which means holding up a phone\/tablet.<\/span><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Measure App<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The mobile application called Measure merely is fantastic. As you can guess by the name, <strong>the app measures the distance of an object or wall from you with the help of a camera<\/strong>. Apple iOS 12 has <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/augmented-reality-ios-12\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>used augmented reality into this<\/strong><\/a>. There is an expectation\u00a0that iOS 12 will come up with new and unique values since many other brands are offering the same app service. This app is straightforward to understand and operate.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8419\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-Features-measures-app.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features measure app\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shortcut Apps<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>As the name suggests, Apple has launched shortcut apps. The possible third-party applications that you would need will be displayed on the screen. Now, how does this happen and on what basis? Apple has used Siri for this purpose. Apple claims that in iOS 12, Siri is going to help users and will be making their lives much more comfortable. For instance, <strong>if the user says to Siri; \u201cI want to have coffee\u201d, then Siri will automatically order coffee that user usually has<\/strong>. Siri will be storing every precise information about user\u2019s activities and will be offering the best results.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8424\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-features-shortcuts-app-456x800.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features shortcut apps\" width=\"288\" height=\"504\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Improved Notifications<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>With its new update, Apple is paving the way for an improvement in the <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/apple-ios-12-notifications-update\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Notification Center<\/strong><\/a>. iOS 12 will support the feature of grouped notifications. <strong>It means that rather than receiving notifications in a single app in a messy way, the users would see them in a grouped way<\/strong>. The notifications would line up in a stack, making it more comfortable. The users can expand and check them using the 3D view.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8423\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-ios-12-features-notifications.gif\" alt=\"top ios 12 features notifications\" width=\"386\" height=\"670\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Screen Time<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Have you ever noticed that you spend too much time on mobile phones and then get late for work or any other important task? Especially students spend too much time on mobile phones. There are many studies and research reports that have described the drawbacks of over usage of smartphones. Any other brand would like their users to spend more and more time on the apps.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8421\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-ios-12-features-screen-time-1.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features screen time\" width=\"640\" height=\"686\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>However, Apple, being one of the best and user-oriented companies, does not want their users to have an addiction to their devices. \u00a0Hence, <strong>iOS 12 will be displaying <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/ios-12-screen-time-feature\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">screen time<\/a> that will show how much time you have spent on the phone since you have started it or unlocked it<\/strong>. It also allows a user to set a limit; say 15 minutes. After 15 minutes or any limit that you have set, a \u201c<strong>Time-up<\/strong>\u201d message will be notified. Parents appreciate this feature a lot.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8422\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-ios-12-features-screen-time-2.jpg\" alt=\"top ios 12 features screen time\" width=\"640\" height=\"686\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Now Siri in more languages<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Ever since Google launched Good Assistant, Apple has been working hard to launch something in the fierce competition. iOS 12 has added 40 languages in Siri.\u00a0Siri has introduced one more feature of suggestions based on device usage. For instance, it will remind you of birthdays or meeting schedules. Also, <strong>Siri will be open to third-party developers with Siri shortcuts<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><strong><\/strong><strong>See Also:\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/third-party-apple-watch-faces-support\/\">Third Party Apple Watch Faces Support Under Development<\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>11. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Additional Privacy<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Remarketing and retargeting ads annoy us all!
