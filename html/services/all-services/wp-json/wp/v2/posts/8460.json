Companies are basing their apps on it and Apple did not stay behind in investing in this technology too!<\/p>\n<p>By introducing ARKit in iOS 11, Apple brought forth the capabilities and potential of Augmented Reality in millions of phones. However, with the ARKit 2 in <a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/top-ios-12-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>iOS 12<\/strong><\/a>, Apple has moved a step ahead in bringing capabilities like 3D object detection, persistent experiences and shared AR spaces.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>3D object detection<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Unlike <strong>ARKit<\/strong>, that could only detect flat objects, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/in\/newsroom\/2018\/06\/apple-unveils-arkit-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>ARKit 2<\/strong><\/a> comes with the capability to detect fully 3D objects. Mainly, it would help users in enjoying experiences like playing with digital Lego bricks with other people.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8461 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Augmented-Reality-in-iOS-12-3D-object-detection.jpg\" alt=\"Augmented Reality iOS 12 3D object detection\" width=\"750\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Persistent experiences<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Once you link your physical world with your digital world, you can place digital objects around. The next time you open the app, you will find the objects right there. And, you can resume your interaction from where you left it.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Shared AR spaces:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Using this, multiple users can see and interact with one another in the same Augmented Reality scene at the same time, using their own individual devices. The way they would be interacting with the environment would be based on their own perspective. All of these shared experiences would make the users more engaged with their iPhones or iPads.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8463\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8463\" style=\"width: 480px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8463 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Augmented-Reality-in-iOS-12-ar-spaces.gif\" alt=\"Augmented Reality iOS 12 ar spaces\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\">Image via <a href=\"http:\/\/apple.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple<\/a><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>As a sample, Apple released a Swift multiplayer game, Swiftshot. This is how it works; at most six players can play together, in two different teams that would be sharing one common game board which would be on a physical surface.<\/p>\n<p>Alongside this whole ARKit 2, Apple has also introduced its very own <strong>Augmented Reality measuring app<\/strong>. This app, known as \u201c<strong>Measure App<\/strong>\u201d does exactly what its name suggests. It is capable of measuring 3D objects in the real world &amp; the sizes of areas.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8419 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-iOS-12-Features-measures-app.jpg\" alt=\"augmented reality ios 12 measure app\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>For instance, if you point your iPhone or iPad at a poster or any rectangular object, you can get a full set of measurements! Another add-on is that the users can click a photo and share it along with its exact dimensions from their device itself.<\/p>\n<p>Since the release of iOS 11, Apple has successfully invested in Augmented Reality and now with the ARKit 2, it is obvious that its focus is still on AR!
