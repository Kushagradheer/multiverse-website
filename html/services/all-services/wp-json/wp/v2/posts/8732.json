Who exactly is an ETL developer? Firstly, ETL refers to Extract, Transform and Load and suggests quite explicitly the working of an ETL developer as well.<\/p>\n<p>ETL is the implementation of loading data in the data warehousing environment of a business. In simpler terms, it states that you need to copy or send your data from your businesses processes and load it into the data warehouse. The reason for doing it is so that all the information is up-to-date.<br \/>\nNow, an <strong>ETL developer<\/strong> is the one who is responsible for designing the data storage system for the company. Also, they are the ones to test it before it goes live.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>Now, an ETL developer is responsible for three things majorly:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Extraction of data:<\/strong> The developer is responsible for managing the extraction tools which extract data from the diverse data sources that the company uses. These include databases, SaaS services, mobile apps etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformation of data:<\/strong> The next aspect comprises of the corrections or additions. The developer needs to make a processing engine that would assure that any corrections or transformations that need to happen to remain in place. This tool would also manage all the new data that arrive later in future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Loading of data:<\/strong> The final thing that the developer needs to take care of is the Loading. Completely in contrast to the first stage, this stage requires the developer to make a tool that is capable of loading the data that was initially collected and added to a data warehouse.<\/p>\n<p>Even when the accomplishment of these three steps happens, the developer\u2019s job doesn\u2019t end. They must ensure that their designs run smoothly and no problem occurs.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, an ETL developer should be a highly technical person. And should focus on establishing the best infrastructure that suits the needs of data team of a company.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What are some major skills that every ETL developer should possess?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>By performing the tasks of Extracting, Transforming &amp; Loading; ETL Development can make the lives of Data teams very much easier! However, even to accomplish this goal, there are some skills that every ETL developer must have in them. Check out the following list!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>Structured Query Language:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p>SQL is a database language that lets you access as well as manipulate databases. There are other available query languages as well. SQL happens to be the most popular one because of its benefits.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, it can insert records in a database and retrieve them. It can update them and delete them. It can also execute queries against a database! Basically, every dimension of ETL can happen with SQL, hence its popularity! This is why it is vital for ETL developers to have more than just intermediate knowledge in this language.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>Setting up parameters:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Being able to parameterize your ETL job gives an upper hand in efficiently saving some time. Also, using parameterization in the ETL code helps in increasing the reusability of the code. Hence, developers should be very much aware of this whole concept.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>Scripting language:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The tools of ETL are sufficient enough. However, there are times when they prove inefficient in completing the requirements. This means that the developer would have to face some trouble here.<\/p>\n<p>Although, if they are familiar with scripting languages like Python or Bash (or others), they can be aided from juggling with files and complications in getting permissions for their ETL!<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>Creativity:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p>It is not always necessary that as an ETL developer, you get everything that you need on a platter. Yes, it is possible that sometimes you get a Source to Target Mapping. That would be an accurate structure of what you have to do. However, the other times you might have to develop everything and create all the mappings from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this would open up various possibilities and options from which you will have to choose and put your creativity in order! So, the more out-of-the-box ideas you have, the better the result would be.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>Problem-solving:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>ETL Development companies<\/strong><\/a> are very well aware of the process in which things flow. Nothing really works exactly according to what and how you plan. There are certain restrictions and timeframes that you need to follow, according to the need of your company.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Hence, the developer needs to have the ability to be able to look through that and solve problems. Also, this is where all the above-mentioned skills play a role!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With a plethora of diversified activities and information enveloping businesses and organizations from every dimension, it has become more than just a task to manage them all together.
