However, few enterprises are making a move to utilize IoT for the betterment of the users.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, at Computex, Microsoft unveiled Window 10 IoT Core Services for the public preview. The Windows 10 IoT Core services enable IoT solutions that are processing or running on the IoT Core Services to commercialize. Thus, organizations can create long-term business models for enhancing business values.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we will see what Windows 10 IoT core is? Moreover, what are the benefits of Windows 10 IoT core services?<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What is Windows 10 IoT Core?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Window 10 IoT core is from the IoT family of Microsoft Windows IoT. Microsoft rebranded \u201cWindows Embedded\u201d to \u201cWindows 10\u201d.\u00a0 Windows 10 IoT Core\u00a0optimize for devices with or without displays. It can run on both x86\/x64 and ARM devices.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>There are two primary services that Windows 10 IoT core offers:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Device Update Center:<\/strong> Here, overall device performance can be seen, and updates can be scheduled. These scheduled updates are delivered via Content Delivery Network.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Security:<\/strong> With the combination of Azure IoT Device Management and <a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/mt750346.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Device Health Attestation<\/span><\/a> (DHA), device security and device safety are analyzed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9693\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Windows-10-IoT-Core-services.png\" alt=\"Windows 10 IoT Core services\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that they would release a pricing model and 10-year support for both Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and Windows 10 IoT Core. Along with that a partnership with NXP to support IoT Core on i.MX 6 and i.MX 7 processors.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the Windows 10 IoT Core Services are not free of costs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>The pricing model of Microsoft is as follows:<\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8211; In the preview phase, the price of IoT Core Services for businesses and solutions is $0.15 per device per month. After the preview stage, the price will be 2x times, and it will be $0.30 per device per month.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Pay-as-you-go service will be available for the customers who are members of the CSP (Cloud Solution Provider). This feature will be available later in the year, and this will facilitate to opt for the subscription that meets your device requirements.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) can go for the pre-paying option and can get a license for the service.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">What are the benefits of Windows 10 IoT core services?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The three primary benefits that Windows 10 IoT Services offers are as given below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. <u>Update Control:<\/u><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>To develop, customize and control device updates DUC (Device Update Control) offers update control functionality. With the help of CDN (Content Distribution Network), the updates can be distributed to tens of thousands of Windows users. These updates can implement on the device drivers, operating systems, and OEMs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. <u>A Decade Tenure:<\/u><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Yes, for next 10 years, any updates to keep the device security integrated, Windows 10 IoT Core service will be for 10 years supporting all Windows OS through LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel). As LTSC provides device stability by optimizing the changes on the base or standard OS, thus, Microsoft aims to release new LTSC oriented updates that help to make appropriate updates into the OS.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. <u>High-Security Approach:<\/u><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>DHA is offering hardware-attested security to organizations and OEMs. This service guides us about the device health or performance and by combining it with Azure IoT Device Management you can manage actions like denying network access or re-imaging the device, etc.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>In the coming years, we are inevitably going to witness a wave of various IoT devices that will inevitably drive the world towards the one platform by connecting all.
