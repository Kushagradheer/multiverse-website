These browse about any little thing and can visit numerous websites to gain information. An average user used to visit 89 websites per month in the year 2010. After 8 years, the data has changed a lot. What do you notice first when you visit a website? The first thing a user seeks is information. But what if the user is not looking for information? What if the client is looking for services or products? Reason can be anything but the primary thing is the user interface and user experience must be excellent.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><b>What is the User Interface?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>The user interface is nothing but a simple to understand and access design that interacts with the users. This is a way through which an internet user interacts with the website. User interface contributes to improving the user&#8217;s overall experience. Touch screen interfaces, icons, menu bar, toolbar, windows, buttons, and images are some parts of the user interface.<\/p>\n<p>These elements influence the user\u2019s decisions with great efficiency. Hence these are the factors to concentrate on. Websites need to be user-friendly. If any website is difficult to understand, the color combination of web pages are ambiguous, there are higher chances of increased bounce rate. The color grids are supposed to be pleasant for the eyes and all buttons should be handy.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read More:<\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/animation-used-in-user-interface-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How is Animation used in User Interface Design?<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8181\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/What-is-Conceptual-Animation.jpg\" alt=\"What is Conceptual Animation?\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><b>What is the User Experience?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>User experience in the terms of websites is nothing but offering an experience that meets the exact user needs with no fuss and bother. While strategizing user experience, it is not enough to provide what the end users are looking for. Rather, offering something extra that is unsaid and not asked. In the marketing language, fulfilling consumer\u2019s demands offer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>But offering something more, beyond expectations delights the end users. A delighted user is better than a satisfied user. It boosts the brand loyalty. For instance, when you buy a refrigerator, the dealer installs it for free and charges no installation fees. These delights end users.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Read More:<\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The Future with AI: How AI Impact UX Designing?<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3><b>Users leave websites within few seconds for 2 major reasons:<\/b><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li>When they do not get anything useful. Users visit any website for one primary reason that is information. Information can be about anything like any topic, brand, product or service. If the user does not get proper information, he or she can immediately close the window and leave the website.<\/li>\n<li>When a user does not know what to do. Many websites and mobile apps attempt to deliver some extraordinary features and end up in confusing users. Many times consumers do not understand which button to click and which option to select.<br \/>\nAlso, content plays an important role. Developers might select some unique alternatives for simple words. For instance, Say Hello for the Contact Us button. This might confuse the user and ultimately the user will leave the website.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a class=\"line\" href=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/blog\/ux-vs-ui-infographic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UI UX designers are different<\/a>.
