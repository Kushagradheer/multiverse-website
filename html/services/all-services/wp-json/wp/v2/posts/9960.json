The best way to find your target audience is first to find the most common problems faced by smartphone users.<\/p>\n<p>Before <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a class=\"line\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.olacabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ola<\/a><\/span> came in, cab drivers had great difficulty in finding passengers and vice versa. Think out of the box and find the pain point of the target audience.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. <span class=\"line\">Strategies:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Once you are aware of the problem of the target audience, you can start strategizing what exactly should be built. In this phase, developers can create a prototype on paper and create a clear image of exactly they are going to build.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. <span class=\"line\">Decide the players:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>In the development of on-demand apps, there are various players involved such as consumer, service provider, delivery executive, customer support, etc.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10005\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/on-demand-delivery-app.png\" alt=\"on-demand-apps-industry\" width=\"750\" height=\"418\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text_bg\">On-Demand Players<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. <span class=\"line\">Collaborate with third-party apps:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>To develop a fantastic on-demand app, you must collaborate with third-party apps such as payment gateway apps, GPS, maps, social media apps. Payment gateway apps enable users to pay online in a single click that saves their time and efforts.<\/p>\n<p>If you are developing a <strong>location-based on-demand app<\/strong>, syncing maps and GPS system is a must. Without these, an app cannot function.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>service based on-demand apps<\/strong> too, maps and GPS is necessary for the executive to deliver correctly.<\/p>\n<p>Now why collaborate with social media? As we all know, social media is an excellent platform for <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2crowd.com\/sms-marketing\" title=\"SMS marketing\">SMS Marketing<\/a> and branding purposes. Integrating your app with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. will help consumers share their experience on their accounts and ultimately increase the awareness of brands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"get_quote\"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-10008 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/theninehertz.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/developing-on-demand-apps.jpg\" alt=\"on-demand apps development\" width=\"750\" height=\"120\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. <span class=\"line\">Offer real-time tracking:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Consumers, as well as app development companies, must be able to track the order in real time. Usually, very cool animations are used in real time tracking to make it more fun to use. With this feature, the consumer can contact the executive or customer support if the track shows a long pause.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. <span class=\"line\">Push notifications:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Consumers will not hold the phone in hand until they receive the order! To update them, push notifications are sent. For example, in location-based on-demand apps such as Uber, the user gets notified if the cab is late due to traffic or when cab reaches the pickup point.<\/p>\n<p>In food ordering apps, the user gets the notifications when the restaurants accept the order, when the order is dispatched, when a delivery guy reaches near your given location, etc. Push notifications also play an essential role in informing about new arrivals, discounts, offers, etc.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. <span class=\"line\">Favorites:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>This is nothing but storing consumer\u2019s order history. This data is analyzed, and personalization is offered. Personalization is nothing but displaying favorites while the consumer is surfing on the internet. Also, the consumer can order directly from the list of favorites.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. <span class=\"line\">Reviews and ratings:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Consumers can put their thoughts on the service offered by giving ratings and writing reviews. These reviews are analyzed and used in the betterment of service. It increases consumer loyalty.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. <span class=\"line\">Customer support:<\/span><\/h3>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><\/div>\n<p>Customer support is essential in every on-demand app as it resolves any problem faced by end users. If the consumer is unable to contact service provider or delivery executive, he or she can always reach out to customer support and get an answer to every problem.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><\/div>\n<p>On-demand apps are in demand and must be developed efficiently to stand firm in the growing competition.
